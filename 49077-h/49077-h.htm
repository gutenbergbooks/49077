<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>This little book is written for three classes of readers&mdash;for
horse-owners who may interest themselves in the subject, for
farriers who are open to conviction, and for veterinary students
who have to be examined.</p>

<p>The method pursued has been, to first describe the form
and action of the foot, next the preparation of the foot for
shoeing. Then the form of a shoe is treated of and the details
to be observed in making it. The selection of shoes for
varieties of feet or for special kinds of work follows, and afterwards
the fitting and nailing-on are considered. Other chapters
are devoted to "roughing," shoeing defective feet, accidents,
the use of leathers and pads.</p>

<p>Throughout an endeavour has been made to be as simple
and clear as possible in expression, to lay down correct general
principles and to point out the technical details which are
essential to good shoeing. On all these points authorities are
not agreed, and I trust those who differ from me will pardon
any too dogmatic expressions of opinion in these pages.</p>

<p>The illustrations will be of assistance in making clear the
text. Some of these are copied from books, some are drawn
from models or preparations, and some are diagramatic. The
books I am indebted to are, "Anatomy of the Domestic
Animals," by Gamgee and Laws; "On the Horse's Foot,"
by Bracy Clark; Bouley's "Atlas of the Foot," and Goyau's
"Maréchalerie."</p>

<big><big><big><b>ART OF HORSE-SHOEING</b></big></big></big><br />
<big><b>A MANUAL FOR FARRIERS.</b></big></p>



<hr class="r5" />


<h2 class="no-break"><a name="I">CHAPTER I.</a></h2>


<p>Farriery is the art of shoeing horses, and can only be
properly learned by a long practical experience in the shoeing-forge.
If the foot of the horse were not a living object
perhaps the training obtained in the forge would be all that
was necessary for efficient workmanship. As, however, the
hoof is constantly growing it is constantly changing its form.
The duty of a farrier therefore is not merely to fix a shoe
upon the hoof but to reduce the hoof to proper proportions
before doing so. Now as hoof is only the outer covering of a
complex and sensitive foot, damage to the exterior surface
may injure the structures within. Injury does frequently
result, and not always from carelessness. Perhaps as much
injury follows careful work, based upon wrong principles, as
slovenly work carried out in perfect ignorance of any principle.
The injury to feet resulting from shoeing may not be apparent
at once. It may be, and often is, of a slow and gradual
nature, and not credited to its true cause until the horse is
rendered an incurable cripple.</p>

<p>It seems evident then that to do justice to a horse a farrier
should not only possess manipulative skill, but should have a
correct idea of the structures and functions of the foot, as
well as a thorough knowledge of the form and variations
of the hoof.</p>

<p>Few persons appreciate the importance of horse-shoeing,
whilst a small number tell us it is unnecessary. Here and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>there an enthusiast has the courage of his convictions and
is able, for a time, to exhibit animals doing work without
shoes. In some countries horses are regularly ridden with
no addition to their natural hoof, but in such places the surface
over which the animals travel is grass land. In all
civilised countries where good roads exist shoeing is practised.
The gentleman with a fad who occasionally appears in
England with unshod horses at work is an unconscious
impostor. He sets his little experience against the common
sense and universal practice of others. No man of business
would pay for shoeing if he could do without it. The
"shoeless" experiment has been tried over and over again,
but always with the same result&mdash;a return to shoeing. In
dry weather the hoof becomes hard, and it is wonderful how
much wear it will then stand on the hardest of roads.
In wet weather the hoof becomes soft, and then the friction
on hard roads soon prohibits work without shoes. If work be
persisted in, under such circumstances, the hoof rapidly wears
away and lameness results. Persons trying to prove a
pre-conceived theory meet this difficulty by resting the horse
until the horn grows, but business men who keep horses for
work in all weathers can afford no such luxury. Shoeing has
been called "a necessary evil." The phrase is a misuse of
words, for there is no necessary evil about it. Of course
it is no more free from accident than other operations, but
its evils are fairly described as accidents, whilst its benefits
are fully apparent. Without shoes horses at work would
be more often lame than with them; without shoes horses
could not do half the work they do with them, and so we
need not further discuss the necessity of shoeing.</p>

<p>The value of horse-shoeing depends upon the manner in
which it is done. Very seldom does the owner of horses
appreciate the quality of the work. As a rule the price
charged, or the distance from the forge to the stable, regulates
the choice of a farrier. Not having any pecuniary interest
in the trade, I may say that such matters should not be
allowed to decide between one farrier and another. A bad
workman may do an injury at one shoeing which will cost
the owner of the horse more than would pay ten times over
the difference between his charges and the higher prices of a
better man.</p>

<p>Many years ago I knew a firm who changed their farrier
and system of shoeing for a cheaper plan. The cost for
shoeing alone fell very considerably, but the cost of horse-flesh
rose in one year more than £100. The old saw&mdash;"that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
for want of a nail the shoe was lost, for want of a shoe the
horse was lost, and for want of a horse the man was lost,"
has been illustrated times without number. Few persons,
however, are aware of the terrible consequences which have
more than once attended neglect in the shoeing of horses.
Napoleon's retreat from Moscow depended for most of its
hardships and horrors upon the simple fact that his horses
were not shod properly for travelling on snow and ice. The
horses could not keep their feet, and were unable to drag the
guns and waggons, which had to be abandoned. During
the Franco-Prussian war, Bourbaki's retreat became a confused
rout from a similar cause. In civil life no winter passes
without injury and death to hundreds of horses from the same
neglect. These are instances that anyone can see; but heavy
losses due to bad shoeing are constant from other or less
evident evils&mdash;from the adoption of wrong methods and the
practice of erroneous theories.</p>

<p>The farrier has not been fairly treated by the public. His
practical knowledge has been ignored, he has been instructed
by amateurs in all sorts of theories, and coerced into carrying
out practices for the untoward results of which he has been
blamed. The natural consequence of all this has been that
the art of farriery degenerated, and the farrier was forced
into a position destructive to the self-respect of any craftsman.
In no other trade do persons entirely ignorant of the business
presume to direct and dictate as to how the work should be
done. No one presumes to instruct the watch-maker or
bell-hanger as to the details of his craft, but the farrier has
been compelled to take his instructions from all sorts and
conditions of men.</p>

<p>Only in recent years has the man who shoes horses been
allowed to know something of his calling. Various causes
have acted in putting an end to the state of discord, and the
trade is now entering upon a brighter time. The Worshipful
Company of Farriers&mdash;one of those ancient City Guilds which
had survived their original vocation and usefulness&mdash;has
wakened up, and is striving to resume its proper function as
the head and director of the trade over which it ought to
preside. Agricultural Societies have also taken the matter
up, and fostered a healthy emulation amongst farriers by
instituting practical competitions at their shows. Veterinary
Surgeons have devoted considerable research to the elucidation
of the anatomy and physiology of the foot, and many old
errors have been corrected. School Boards have made the
present generation of farriers able and willing to supplement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
their practice by a study of principles. We have, in fact,
arrived at a time when everyone interested seems inclined to
recognise the importance of the art and its technical difficulties,
and when no one has a brand new infallible discovery which
alone can save the horse and guide the farrier.</p>

<p>My object in writing is not to suggest anything new but
to point out the general principles upon which the art is
based, and to indicate those details which are essential to
success, and those which are to be avoided if soundness and
duration of service are recognised as true economy in a stud
of horses.</p>

<h2><a name="II">CHAPTER II.</a><br /><br />


<small><span class="smcap">The Form and Action of the Foot.</span></small></h2>

<p>The foot of a horse consists of a variety of living structures,
differing in form and texture, and enclosed in a horny covering
called the hoof. Although the farrier's work is applied
only to the hoof it is necessary that he should know something
of the whole foot, because it is but too easy to injure
the structures within by alterations of the horny covering
without.</p>

<p>The simplest way to understand the foot is to study
separately the different parts, and to apply that knowledge
in obtaining a general idea of the relations of all the parts
to each other. There is not then much difficulty in appreciating
the functions of each part, and the uses and action of
the whole organ.</p>


<h3 class="no-break"><span class="smcap">The Hoof.</span></h3>


<p>Everyone is familiar with the general appearance of the
hoof. It is not a regular geometrical figure. Each of the
four feet of the horse shows some peculiarity in form, by
which a farrier can at once identify a fore from a hind or a
left from a right.</p>

<p>The fore feet should be similar in size and shape. Disease
may be suspected when any marked difference exists. But
a healthy hoof which has been broken, or much rasped, does
not retain its proper form and may thus confuse a novice.</p>

<p>The hind feet should be proportionate in size to the fore,
and then it is not of much practical consequence whether the
whole are large or small.</p>

<p>The front feet are rounder and less pointed at the toe than
the hind; they are also more sloping in front. The two
fore feet and the two hind should be in pairs. The right and
left feet are distinguished from each other by the inner side
being more upright or, if examined on the under surface,
by the outer border being more prominent.</p>

<p>Although to a casual observer the hoof appears as one
continuous horny structure, it may easily be separated into
three distinct parts by prolonged soaking in water. The
division takes place so as to leave the sole, frog, and wall
separate portions. These may now be considered.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span><b>The Wall</b> is that portion of the hoof seen whilst the foot
rests upon the ground. It covers the front and sides of the
foot. It extends from the coronet downwards and slightly
outwards so that its lower circumference is greater than its
upper. The front portion shows its greatest height and
obliquity, diminishing in these respects as it passes backwards.
At the heels the wall is turned in upon itself, and
passes forward towards the centre of the foot until it becomes
lost in the structure of the sole. These turned-in portions
of the wall are called <i>the bars</i>, and serve two purposes; they
increase the bearing surface of the wall, and by embracing
a part of the sole on each side, they afford an increased
solidity to the union of the wall with the rest of the hoof.</p>

<p>If we detach the wall its inner surface is seen to consist of
a number of thin horny projections running parallel to each
other from above downwards and forwards. These are
called the horny laminæ. They number from five to six
hundred and correspond to similar processes on the sensitive
foot. (<a href="#Fig003">Fig. 3</a>).</p>

<p class="center">Fig. 3.&mdash;Half of a Hoof, showing the inside.</p>
</div>
</div>



<p>Round the upper circumference on the inside of the wall
is a depression or groove presenting innumerable small pits
or openings. This corresponds to a part of the sensitive foot
called the coronary band, which will be noticed again.</p>

<p>A section of wall enables us to see variations in its thickness.
(<a href="#Fig004">Fig. 4</a>). It is thickest at the toe, becoming gradually
thinner towards the heels; thus affording strength and
solidity to resist wear at one part, as well as pliancy at

<p class="center">Fig. 4.&mdash;Transverse Section of Wall showing variation in thickness.</p>
</div>
</div>



<p>The structure of the wall is fibrous&mdash;the fibres running
parallel to each other, and with the same obliquity as that
presented by the front of the wall. Although the wall varies
in thickness from before backwards, it does not from above
downwards. It maintains the same thickness from the
coronet to its lower circumference.</p>

<p>The layers of the wall are hardest externally, becoming
softer as they approach the inner surface&mdash;a condition due
to the outer layers being exposed to friction and evaporation.
This is a simple and valuable provision of nature which
should not be interfered with. The hard outer layer is best
adapted to withstand wear, and its density protects the deeper
layers from evaporation. This maintains the whole wall at
the degree of softness and toughness which best preserves
elasticity and strength of horn.</p>


<p class="p2"><b>The Sole</b> is that division of the hoof which forms the
floor of the foot. It is situated within the lower border of
the wall, and is slightly arched so that on a hard level
surface its central part takes no bearing. (<a href="#Fig005">Fig. 5</a>). Posteriorly
the sole is divided by a triangular space into which the frog
fits, and thus its continuation to the heels consists of two
angular portions embraced between the bars and the wall.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>The unmutilated sole is throughout of nearly equal thickness,
but a slight excess round the circumference gives firmer
attachment to the wall.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">Fig. 5.&mdash;The Sole with Frog removed.</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>The inner surface presents a finely pitted appearance which
is most marked at the toe and round its border. The part
immediately related to the frog shows few pits, and we shall
find that the whole surface corresponds to the sensitive parts
to which it is attached.</p>

<p>The structure of the sole is, like the wall, fibrous; but the
fibres are smaller. They run downwards and forwards in
the same direction as those of the wall. The outer layers are
the hardest and protect the deeper from injury.</p>


<p class="p2"><b>The Frog</b> is the smallest division of the hoof, and is
a triangular shaped body filling up the space left between
the bars. (<a href="#Fig006">Fig. 6</a>). Its broad base is rounded and prominent,
and is continued laterally by a thin layer which binds together
the heels and envelopes the back of the foot. This thin
layer is continuous with a horny band extending round the
upper part of the wall at its junction with the hair, and
sometimes prolonged downwards on the surface of the wall.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>(<a href="#Fig007">Fig. 7</a>). It appears to be a continuation of the outer layer
of the skin, analogous to the free border of skin at the root of
the human nail. (<a href="#Fig008">Fig 8</a>). It serves the useful purpose
of covering and protecting the young horn of the wall at
its source of growth.</p>

</div>



<p>The point of the frog, much the harder part, extends
forward to the centre of the sole. Though situated between
the bars the frog is only attached to their upper border&mdash;the
sides remaining free and separate. Thus on each side is
formed a deep fissure which permits the frog to expand
laterally when compressed, without such force being continued
to the sides of the foot. The frog is elastic, and when
pressed upon must expand slightly. If these spaces between
frog and bars did not exist, the foot would be injured when
the frog was compressed by the weight of the horse&mdash;either
the sensitive parts within would be bruised or the heels
would be forced apart.</p>

<p>The centre of the frog presents a depression or "cleft"
caused by the doubling in of the horn. Few shod feet
exhibit it of natural appearance, and the term cleft, by implying
a narrow deep fissure, keeps up the false notion. The
cleft should be shallow and rounded. It serves two purposes&mdash;it
increases the mobility of the frog, and by breaking
the regularity of surface affords a secure foot-hold on level
ground.</p>

<p>The prominence of the frog might lead a superficial observer
to consider it a thick solid mass; and I believe this
mistake is the cause of its too frequent mutilation. It is
merely a layer of horn following the outline of the structures
within, which are similarly prominent and irregular in surface.
(<a href="#Fig009">Figs. 9</a> and <a href="#Fig010">10</a>). The diagrams show a section through
the point and through the cleft of the frog.</p>

<p>The frog is fibrous, though not to such a marked degree
as the other portions of the hoof. Its chief qualities are
elasticity and toughness.</p>



<h3 class="no-break"><span class="smcap">The Secreting Structures.</span></h3>



<p>If we macerate a dead foot in water for a week or two,
the hoof may be removed entire without injuring the tissues
within. In this way the sensitive foot or "quick" is exposed
to view, and presents an exact counterpart of the inside of
the hoof. The sensitive foot consists of a layer of fibrous
tissue stretched over the bones and other structures which
form the centre of the foot. It is plentifully supplied with
blood-vessels and nerves necessary to its double function as
the source of horn growth and as the tactile organ of the
foot. Horn is, of course, not sensitive, although the slightest
touch on a horse's hoof is recognised by the animal, and this
feeling is due to the impression made upon the sensitive foot.
In the living horse any injury to the "quick" causes the
greatest pain, and although this sensitiveness is a serious
disadvantage in disease it is a most valuable provision in
health, enabling the horse, even through a thick layer of horn,
to recognise the quality of the surface upon which he may be
standing or moving. It is this sense of touch&mdash;this tactile
function&mdash;which demands that the sensitive foot should be so
bountifully supplied with nerves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>Every farrier knows how profusely blood flows from any
wound of the "quick"&mdash;evidence that the part is well supplied
with blood-vessels. This full supply of blood is not merely
for the ordinary waste and repair which takes place in every
tissue; it is to meet a special demand&mdash;to supply the material
for the production of horn. The sensitive foot is the secreting
structure of the hoof, and the source of the constant growth
and reproduction of horn. It corresponds with great exactness
to the inside of the hoof, and as we have described the hoof
in sections it may be convenient to follow that course with
this structure, and to describe the <i>sensitive frog</i>, the <i>sensitive
sole</i>, and the <i>sensitive laminæ</i>. We shall begin with
the last.</p>


<p class="p2"><b>The Sensitive Laminæ.</b> Corresponding to the horny
leaves on the inside of the wall, the sensitive foot presents an
arrangement of minute parallel folds which are called the
sensitive laminæ. (<a href="#Fig011">Fig. 11</a>). Between these the horny
laminæ rest, so that there is a kind of interleaved attachment
which affords the very firmest connection between the wall
and the sensitive foot. If the laminæ be laid bare in a living
horse by removal of the wall, it is found that they have the
power to secrete a kind of horn, not a hard fibrous horn like
that of the wall, but a softer variety. This function is not
very active in health or we should find that the lower edge of
the wall was thicker than the upper; but it exists, and is
very evident in some cases of disease.</p>



<p><a name="Fig011"></a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 65%" >
<img src="images/017.jpg" alt="" style="width: 80%" />
<div class="caption">
<p class="center">Fig. 11.&mdash;Foot with hoof removed showing at the upper part the
Coronary band, and below the Sensitive Laminæ.</p>
</div>
</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>
<p>In laminitis the wall at the toe is often pushed forward
out of position by a horny mass formed by the laminæ, and
so we have the deformity of an excessive length of toe. In
some cases of long continued sandcrack the irritation of the
laminæ causes excessive secretion, and a horn tumour results.
The sensitive laminæ, then, fulfil two functions; they offer
a firm connecting medium for the wall, and they secrete
horn. By the cruel experiment of removing the horny
sole and frog of a living horse and then forcing him to stand
on the maimed foot on a level surface, it has been shown
that the laminæ are capable of alone supporting the weight
of the animal. It has been argued from this that the
laminæ always support the weight, and that the horse's
foot may be described as being slung by the connecting
laminæ. This is not true. The frog and sole help to
support weight, and the hoof acts as one continuous whole,
each part taking its direct and proportionate share of the
weight placed upon the foot. The sensitive laminæ are not
elastic, they are unyielding, and, therefore, allow no downward
yielding which would impose excessive pressure on the sole.</p>


<p class="p2"><b>The Coronary Band.</b> (See <a href="#Fig011">Fig. 11</a>). The sensitive
laminæ do not cover the whole of the upright portions of
the sensitive foot. There is between their upper extremity
and the line which separates the skin from the sensitive foot,
a convex band which runs round the upper border of the
foot, and is turned downwards and inwards at the heels.
This is called the coronary band, and corresponds to the
groove which we noticed on the inner side of the upper border
of the wall. On its surface are innumerable small projections
or papillæ which, in the living animal, fit into
the openings on the groove of the wall. From each of
these papillæ grows a horn fibre, and from the surface between
them is formed a softer horny matter&mdash;the two products
forming together the substance of the wall. The
coronary band is, then, an important structure, being the
source from whence the wall is produced. Upon the healthy
condition of this band depends the soundness of the wall,
and any interference with its integrity must lead to defects
or deformities in the wall.</p>


<p class="p2"><b>The Sensitive Sole</b> (<a href="#Fig012">Fig. 12</a>) is that portion of the
"quick" to which the sole is attached. Its surface is covered
with papillæ, like those on the coronary band but much smaller,
giving an appearance somewhat like the pile of velvet. From
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>these the horn fibres of the sole are formed, and a firm
means of connection is afforded for the floor of the hoof.</p>



<p><a name="Fig012"></a></p>

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">Fig. 12.&mdash;Under Surface of Foot showing Sensitive Frog and Sole.</p>
</div>
</div>



<p class="p2"><b>The Sensitive Frog</b> in structure resembles the sensitive
sole, but its papillæ are very much smaller, and the
surface therefore is smoother. The irregular prominent
surface of the frog, with its cleft and the space at each
side of it, is exactly reproduced on the sensitive frog, as
might be expected, for the one is moulded on the other.
There is one difference between the sensitive frog and the
other portions of the sensitive foot which I may here mention.
It is not attached to the bones of the foot except
by its point, but is situated behind the bone, and has as a
basis a mass of soft tissue which forms an important cushion
or pad, to be referred to later.</p>


<h3 class="no-break"><span class="smcap">Growth of Hoof.</span></h3>

<p>Like every other part of an animal body, the hoof is
constantly changing. Wear and tear cause waste of the
horn, which is replenished by growth. When wear exceeds
growth the foot becomes denuded of horn, and lameness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
results. When growth exceeds wear the hoof becomes disproportionately
long, and some parts suffer by the overgrowth
of others&mdash;for instance, whenever the heels are unduly
high the frog becomes small and weak. In a state of nature
the horse's foot keeps itself of proportionate form. On
hard ground the hoof is worn away as quickly as it grows.
On soft ground it may, for a time, become overgrown, but
this is rectified by the soft horn becoming fractured and
broken off. In enclosed cultivated grounds the movements
of the horse, even on grass land, are too limited to ensure a
proportionate form of hoof. When horses are turned out
without shoes the feet should not be left to take care of
themselves, unless the pasture is of large area and the time
at grass extends for several months.</p>

<p>In a hoof which is overgrown&mdash;and all shod feet become
overgrown in four or five weeks&mdash;there is apparently a greater
excess of horn at the toe than elsewhere. This is due to the
oblique direction of the wall at the toe, and to the fact that
the horn fibres of the hoof do not grow down vertically,
but obliquely forward. When the natural wear of the
hoof is prevented, the effect of growth is to lengthen the toe
and carry forward the bearing surface of the foot. Now this
bearing surface has a proper relative position to the limb
above it. Therefore a disproportionate foot must injuriously
affect both the action and position of the whole limb.</p>

<p>The rate at which the wall grows varies greatly in
different horses, and is affected by external conditions. The
good average wall grows nearly one inch in three months, and
the whole hoof is replaced in from ten to fifteen months.
The hoof grows more rapidly when a horse is actively
exercised than when he is confined in a box. Febrile diseases
check growth, and irregularities of the system cause the
formation of ridges in the horn, each one commencing at the
coronet and being carried down with the growing horn until
the hoof is marked by a series of rings running transversely
and parallel to each other. These rings are of themselves no
detriment to a horse, but they mark irregularities of growth
which may have been due to illness or lameness.</p>

<p>The growth of horn on a shod foot is affected by the
bearing it takes. When a part of the wall takes no bearing
on the shoe it grows quicker than that which does. We see
this when a shoe is so fitted that the heels take no direct
pressure on the shoe, also when a portion of wall is broken at
the quarters, and again when, for any reason, a portion of the
edge of the wall has been rasped away to prevent bearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
upon some special spot. In all these cases, after the shoe has
been worn a month, it will be found that the horn has grown
more rapidly at the part where bearing did not take place,
and, when the shoe is removed, the horn which was relieved
of pressure is found to have been in apposition with the shoe.</p>

<p>The growth of horn cannot be accelerated by any application
to its surface. If we desire to hasten growth of the wall
we can do so by stimulating the part from which it is
produced, <i>i.e.</i>, the coronary band. A mild blister to the
coronet causes considerable increase in the rapidity of growth,
but no ointments applied to the surface of the wall affect its
production in the least, though they may modify its condition
and prevent dryness and brittleness.</p>

<p>The sole grows in much the same way as the wall, but it
wears quite differently. It never becomes overgrown to the
extent seen in some instances of the wall. The hard firm
structure of the wall, if not worn down by friction on roads or
dry hard surfaces, may grow to a great length. As a rule, when
much overgrown, it splits in the direction of its fibres and becomes
detached in broken fragments. The sole, when overgrown,
has a tendency to become detached in flakes, and never
very much exceeds its normal thickness without becoming dry
and brittle, when the movements of the horse cause it to
break up and fall off.</p>

<p>The frog when it takes a bearing on the ground wears off
in shreds. A frog which takes no bearing dries up, and
sometimes a large superficial layer is cast off. Though the
softest of the horny divisions of the hoof, the frog is able to
withstand wear and tear as well as any of the others. Being
elastic and resting upon soft tissues, it is able to yield to any
undue pressure and leave the firmer horn of the wall and bars
to sustain the greater strain. The growth of the frog depends
a great deal upon the form of the back parts of the wall.
If the heels become overgrown, the frog is removed from
bearing and consequently wastes. High heels have always
between them a small frog. On the other hand low weak
heels have always a large frog, and the explanation is that
the increased bearing thrown on the frog causes greater
development.</p>


<p class="p2"><b>Properties of Horn.</b> Horn is light, hard, tough, and
elastic, properties most essential to its usefulness as a protector
of the foot. Horn is porous, and absorbs moisture. Too
much moisture in horn weakens it, and therefore it must be
remembered that the natural protection against this is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
hard outer layer of the hoof. When this layer is rasped off
moisture is more easily absorbed until the dry, hard surface
is restored by exposure and friction.</p>

<p>Horn is a bad conductor of heat, and thus an equally good
protective against the effects of snow in some countries, and
of hot dry sands in others. With a sound thick hoof the
application of a red-hot shoe produces very little effect on
the internal structures, provided, of course, it remain in
contact only a reasonable time. With a foot protected by
a thin layer of horn, fitting a red-hot shoe must be done
quickly or it may damage the soft tissues.</p>


<h3 class="no-break"><span class="smcap">Dissection of the Foot.</span></h3>

<p>So far we have only described the outer covering of the
foot and the structure from which it grows and by which it is
connected to the parts within. A little deeper examination is
necessary to understand the mechanism of the whole organ.</p>



<p><a name="Fig011a"></a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 60%" >
<img src="images/022.jpg" alt="" style="width: 80%" />
<div class="caption">
<p class="center">Fig. 11.&mdash;Section of Foot.</p>
</div>
</div>



<p>If we divide into two lateral halves a foot cut off at the
fetlock joint, we have a section which should show the
whole of the deeper structures. In the centre we see the
three lower bones of the limb&mdash;the pastern, coronet, and
pedal. (<a href="#Fig011a">Fig. 11</a>). On the front surface of these bones we
notice a tendon or sinew which comes from above the knee
and is fixed to the upper part of the pedal bone. At the
back of the bones two very large tendons run down and are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>fixed on the last two bones. These tendons are the structures
through which the movements of the foot are made. They
have in themselves no power of contraction but they are
connected above the knee, and in the hind leg above the
hock, to powerful muscles which possess the power of contraction.
When these muscles contract the tendons are
drawn up towards knee or hock, and so move the foot
backwards or forwards.</p>

<p>To permit movement of one bone upon another the ends
of the bones are suitably shaped, and covered with a layer
of gristle or cartilage. To limit the movement and to hold
the bones together the ends of each bone are surrounded by
ligaments, and thus we have joints formed.</p>



<p><a name="Fig012a"></a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 60%" >

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">Fig. 12.&mdash;Side view of Pedal Bone.</p>
</div>
</div>



<p>The pastern bone is altogether above the level of the foot,
the coronet bone is partially within the hoof, and the joint
between it and the pedal bone is quite within. The pedal,
often called the coffin bone, (<a href="#Fig012a">Fig. 12</a>) is entirely within the
hoof and fills the front part of the horny envelope completely.
It is a peculiarly shaped bone, being continued backwards by
two projections which follow the course of the wall to a little
beyond the quarters of the foot. (<a href="#Fig013">Fig. 13</a>). From this point
to the extremity of the heels the wall is not supported by
bone but by strong plates of gristle, which are called the
lateral cartilages.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

</div>
</div>




<p class="p2"><b>The Lateral Cartilages</b> are situated one on either
side of the foot partly within and partly without the hoof.
They form the basis upon which the back part of the wall
is moulded, and being elastic permit a certain amount of
movement in the posterior parts of the foot. (<a href="#Fig014">Fig. 14</a>).
If the coffin bone filled the whole hoof, the foot would
be too rigid. With bone at the front portion we have
a firm surface for attachment, and with cartilage at the back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
we have an equally firm attachment, but one that will yield to
blows or pressure and thus better protect the internal parts.
These cartilages extend above the level of the hoof, and may be
easily felt in the living horse at the back part of the coronet.
(<a href="#Fig015">Fig. 15</a>). Between them, and behind the body of the coffin
bone is a large space which is filled up by a mass of soft
tissue to which various names have been given, such as
plantar-cushion, frog-pad, etc.</p>



<p><a name="Fig015"></a></p>

</div>




<p class="p2"><b>The Frog-Pad</b> is the name under which we shall notice
it. It forms the bulbs of the heels and is the soft basis upon
which is spread the sensitive frog. It extends from side to
side of the foot between the two lateral cartilages, and fills
up all the space within the hoof behind the body of the coffin
bone. The structure of this pad may be described roughly as
consisting of a network of fibrous bands, having the interstices
filled up with elastic tissue. (<a href="#Fig016">Fig. 16</a>). Down the centre of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>the pad runs a vertical partition of inelastic fibres; from this
strong fibrous bands pass to each cartilage, and so the whole of
the back part of the foot is tied together. The heels and
quarters may be pressed together to some extent, but they are
prevented from being forced asunder by the fibrous connections
of the frog-pad. During progression the downward
movement of the coronet bone is provided for by this soft pad,
and so is an upward movement of the frog when excessive
bearing is placed upon it.</p>


<p><a name="Fig016"></a></p>

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">Fig. 16.&mdash;Section of foot showing the frog-pad and at each side
the cut edge of the lateral cartilage.</p>
</div>
</div>



<p>The frog-pad serves other purposes besides those we have
just referred to. It is essentially a cushion or pad to prevent
jar or concussion, but it also plays an important part in the
action of the foot, as we shall see later on.</p>


<p class="p2"><b>The Coronary Cushion or Pad</b> is another mass of
tissue of a similar nature to the frog-pad. It is situated just
above the upper border of the hoof, and gives to the coronet
its prominence and elasticity. At this part of the foot there
is an enormous number of small blood-vessels and nerves,
and the coronary pad forms not only a base for these to rest
on but a necessary protection for them. If instead of this
elastic bed they were placed merely between the skin and the
hard bones and tendons of the part, they would be injured by
every slight bruise. Even with this cushion, we have in
practice very many serious conditions following bruise of
the coronet.</p>


<p class="p2"><b>Blood-vessels of the Foot.</b> It is not necessary to
describe the course of these vessels. All we need remember
is that every part of the tissues within the hoof is very
plentifully supplied with blood, and that the flow of blood is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
most rapid when the foot is in action. In a dead foot from
which the blood has escaped a certain amount of movement
of the bones within the hoof is easily effected. In the living
foot when every vessel is filled with blood no such movement
takes place. The blood in the vessels forms a sort of waterbed
which assists in preventing concussion and which distributes
evenly over the whole organ the pressure applied
when weight is thrown on the foot. In studying the dead
foot with a view to understand its mechanism we must not
lose sight of the difference which results from having in one
case the blood-vessels empty, and in the other&mdash;the living
animal&mdash;the blood-vessels full.</p>


<h3 class="no-break"><span class="smcap">The Foot as a whole.</span></h3>

<p>The details I have given of the structure and uses of each
separate part of the foot will, I hope, be sufficient to enable
us to understand the form and action of the organ as a
whole.</p>

<p>No one part of the foot is of greater importance than
another, each is dependent for its highest development and
soundest condition upon the integrity of neighbouring parts.</p>

<p>A weak wall allows of the flattening and spreading of the
sole, whilst a weak sole permits contraction of the wall.
Overgrown heels cause wasting of the frog, but low weak
heels are usually accompanied by excessive development of
frog.</p>

<p>The special function of the foot is to sustain the weight of
the animal whilst standing or moving. The horse standing
squarely on all four feet rests his weight chiefly on the
lower circumference of the wall. On level ground the sole,
on account of its arched form, takes no direct bearing, but
if sole and wall be sound a proportion of all pressure applied
to the wall is transmitted to the sole. So also must all
weight imposed on the arch of the sole be transmitted,
through its abutments or union with the wall, to the wall. If
the sole be so thin that it yields to pressure then its proper
action is destroyed, and instead of acting like an arch and
supporting weight imposed on it, it yields and injury results.
The arched form of the sole indicates that it was not
intended to take a direct bearing on hard ground. On a soft
surface the edge of the wall sinks and the whole under surface
of the foot takes a direct bearing. Pressure of the sole on
the soft surface does no harm because it is diffused evenly
over the whole of the sole. We take advantage of this when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
the wall is diseased or injured, and we desire to throw on the
sole a larger share of weight. We turn such animals out
into a soft field or stable them on sand or saw-dust. Any
system of shoeing founded upon the true form and action of
the foot must recognise the arch, and not endeavour to force
the sole to take a bearing for which it is not adapted. There
is only one part of the sole which should act as a bearing
surface, viz., that outer border which is firmly joined to the
wall. This part&mdash;the abutment of the arch&mdash;is destined by
nature to take a bearing and through it the whole of the
sole supports its share of weight.</p>

<p>The frog takes a bearing on the ground but it has a
weight sustaining function quite secondary to the harder
and firmer parts of the hoof. It is formed of a softer
horn, and it has above it only soft tissues which permit
yielding. The frog then, when weight is placed upon it
by the standing horse, recedes from pressure, and leaves
the heels (wall and bars) to sustain the primary weight.
Wall, sole, and frog, each take their share in supporting
weight, but this function is distributed over them in different
degrees, and it is fulfilled by each in a varying manner.
During progression the foot is repeatedly raised from and
replaced on the ground. It has not only to support
weight but to sustain the effects of contact with the ground
at each step, and the effects of being the point of resistance
when the body is carried forward and the foot is again raised
from the ground.</p>

<p>What part of the foot comes first to the ground? Many
different answers have been given to this question. It has
been said by some that the toe first touches the ground,
by others that the foot is laid flat down, and by a few that
the heel is the first part to come in contact with the ground.
Fortunately it is not now necessary to argue this question on
a purely theoretical basis. Instantaneous photography has
shown that on level ground, at all paces, the horse touches
the ground first with the heel. This fact gives significance
to the structural differences we find between the front and
back portions of the foot. At the back part of the foot we
have the wall thinner than elsewhere, we have the moveable
and elastic frog, the lateral cartilages, and the frog-pad.
We have in fact a whole series of soft and elastic structures
so arranged as to provide a mechanism best adapted to meet
shock and to avoid concussion. Whilst drawing heavy loads, or
ascending or descending hills, the horse may vary his action<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
to suit the circumstances, and then we have the exception
which proves the rule&mdash;then we have sometimes the heel,
sometimes the toe brought first to the ground.</p>

<p>At the time when the foot first touches the ground, the leg
is extended forward and the pastern is in the same oblique
position to the shank as when a horse is standing. This
obliquity of the pastern is another safeguard against concussion,
and it renders impossible the first contact with the
ground at any point other than at the heel. As the leg
becomes straightened, the weight of the body is imposed
upon the foot, but the greatest strain arrives just before
the toe leaves the ground, for then there is not only
weight to sustain, but the friction to be borne which results
from the toe being the fulcrum upon which falls
the whole effect of the muscular effort necessary to raise
and carry forward the body of the animal. The front part
of the foot is structurally well adapted for its use. It presents
the thickest and strongest part of the horny covering,
and, as an inside basis, it has the unyielding coffin bone.
Thus we have at the toe strength and rigidity&mdash;at the heels
strength and elasticity.</p>

<p>Another important point in the action of the foot is
implied by the question&mdash;does it expand when weight is
thrown on it? The principles of horse-shoeing require that
this question should be answered. There are those who
say that the foot does not alternately expand and retract as
weight is placed upon or removed from it. There are others
who assert that the expansion of the foot is an important
natural function that must be provided for in any system
of shoeing. It is agreed by most observers that at the upper
border of the hoof, more particularly at the heels, expansion
does occur. It is when we come to the lower border of the
foot that the statements are most conflicting. Ordinary
measurements taken at this part with calipers or by tracings
on paper of the foot when raised from the ground and when
resting upon it, show no variations in the width of the foot.
These methods of measurement are not sufficiently delicate to
be trustworthy. Experimentalists in Germany and in this
country have recently used an apparatus by which the slightest
variations are detected by electrical contact, and the results
are very interesting. These experiments show that in a well-formed,
healthy foot the hoof throughout its posterior two-thirds
does expand to pressure, and perhaps that the arch of
the sole is slightly flattened. This expansion is, however, com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>paratively
slight&mdash;about equal to the thickness of a sheet
of writing paper&mdash;and may practically be disregarded in
considering the best methods of shoeing sound feet.</p>

<p>One result of these experiments is to show what an important
part the frog plays in the foot, and also how the
action of one part depends upon the conditions of others.
When the frog rests firmly on the ground and weight is
placed upon the foot expansion occurs, especially at the upper
or coronary border of the hoof. When the frog does not
touch the ground and weight is imposed upon the foot, contraction
occurs. The explanation of this difference seems to
be as follows. When weight is placed upon a foot, the
coronet bone is depressed upon the soft mass of the frog-pad.
With a sound frog taking a bearing upon the ground, the
frog-pad cannot descend, and the compression to which it is
therefore submitted causes it to bulge laterally and so expand
the back of the foot. When the frog does not reach the
ground and weight is placed upon the frog-pad, there is
nothing to prevent it yielding downwards, and in so doing
the fibrous bands connecting together the two lateral cartilages
of the foot are depressed and the cartilages drawn
together&mdash;hence the contraction of the foot. No better
illustration could be given of the unity of all parts of the
foot, and how one or many parts may suffer if the structure
or function of one be defective.</p>

<p>There is one more movement of the hoof which is possible
and which must be referred to, as it has been made the basis
of a grave error in shoeing. I have said the back part
of the foot is elastic and yielding. If you examine a shoe,
so applied to a foot that an inch or more of its extremity has
no contact with the hoof, you will find that when weight is
rested on that foot the horn yields downwards and comes in
contact with the shoe. This simply demonstrates that when
there is nothing to support it the horn at the heels may
be forced downwards. It is not a normal action, and in an
unshod foot cannot occur on a level surface. The effect of
this downward movement of the heels is to put a strain on
the horn of the quarters. A shoe so fitted as to permit this
evil is in common use, and no fault is more serious than
thus forcing an unnatural action upon the hoof at every step.
With unintentional irony this piece of bad work has been
called "easing the heels."</p>

<p>In concluding this chapter, I would just repeat that the
natural bearing surface of the horse's foot is the lower edge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
of the wall and that portion of the sole immediately in union
with it; that the arch of the sole should not be in contact
with the ground; that the frog ought to have a bearing on
the ground, but ought not to be so prominent as to unduly share
in sustaining weight. This natural bearing surface is what
we want to utilize in shoeing. We put on a shoe <i>merely to
prevent excessive wear of the hoof</i>. If we can protect the
wall the frog can take care of itself, and we have only so to
apply our shoe that we do not damage any useful structure
or interfere with any natural function.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;No person is expected to learn the structure of a foot entirely
from this description. He must obtain two feet cut off at the
fetlock joint. One he should soak in water till the hoof can be
pulled off. The sensitive foot is then visible and the inside of the
hoof; with these before him, the drawings and descriptions in this
chapter will be of great assistance. The second foot he should have
sawn vertically down the middle through the point of the toe, and
again across the quarters, so as to show the inside of the foot from

<h2><a name="III">CHAPTER III.</a><br /><br />
<small><span class="smcap">Preparation of the Foot.</span></small></h2>



<p>The cheap wisdom of the amateur is often expressed in the
remark "the shoe should be fitted to the foot, not the foot to
the shoe." Like many other dogmatic statements this is only
the unqualified assertion of half a truth. Foot and shoe have
to be fitted to each other. There are very few horses whose
feet do not require considerable alteration before a shoe can
be properly fitted to them. As a rule, when a horse arrives
at the forge, the feet are overgrown and quite out of proportion.
In a few cases&mdash;as when a shoe has been lost on a
journey&mdash;the foot is worn or broken and irregularly deficient
in horn. In either instance the farrier has to make alterations
in the hoof to obtain the best bearing surface before he
fits a new shoe. The claim often made for some novel inventions
in horse shoes, "that they may be fitted and applied
in the stable by a groom or stableman" is evidence of a sad
misunderstanding of the art of horse-shoeing. If shod feet
always remained of the same shape replacement of shoes
would be a very easy matter&mdash;but they never do. The
living foot is constantly changing, and therefore the man
entrusted with fitting shoes to it, must know what its proper
form should be. When he finds it disproportionately overgrown
he must know how much horn to remove&mdash;where to
take away and where to leave alone. He must not carry in
his head a theoretical standard of a perfect foot and attempt
to reduce all feet to that shape. He must make allowance
for varieties of feet, and for many little differences of form
that present themselves in practice. He has, in fact, to
prepare the foot for a shoe, and it is just as important to
do this properly as it is to prepare a shoe for the foot. To
fit a shoe to a foot which has not been properly prepared may
be even more injurious to the horse than "to fit the foot
to the shoe."</p>

<p>The general principle to be followed is&mdash;to remove superfluous
horn, to obtain a good bearing surface for a shoe,
to bring all parts of the hoof equally into proportion. A good
foot so prepared, when the horse is standing on level ground
should show, when looked at from the front, both sides of the
wall of equal height; the transverse line of the coronet should
be parallel with the line of the lower border of the hoof, and</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>
<p>the perpendicular line of the leg should cut those lines at
right angles. (<a href="#Fig017">Fig. 17</a>). When looked at from the side the
height of the heels and the toe should be proportionate. When
looked at from behind the frog should be seen touching the
ground. On lifting the foot a level bearing surface wider
than the wall should be presented, extending from heel to toe
all round the circumference of the hoof; within this level
border, the sole should be concave, strong, and rough.</p>


<p><a name="Fig017"></a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 50%" >

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>



<p>In <a href="#Fig017">Fig. 17</a> is shown the foot on its ground surface and
from the side. The parallel lines are quite arbitrary, but
assist in explaining how the proportion of the foot is to be
attained. Both sides of the foot are of the same height.
The bearing surface just meets the middle line. All the
lines at coronet, heel, and toe, are at right angles to the
perpendicular line. The side view shows the proportionate
height of heel and toe, and the slope of the wall in front.
Compared with <a href="#Fig022">Figs. 22</a> and <a href="#Fig023">23</a> deviations from proportion
are seen.</p>

<p>These conditions are not attainable with all feet, but the
prudent farrier does the best he can under the circumstances.
It is easy to make the frog touch the ground by over-lowering
the heels, but this is only introducing one evil in attempting
to avoid another. Some feet have naturally a long toe with
an excessive slope of the front part of the wall. To hide this
defect a farrier may "stump up" the toe and leave the heels
too high, but he does so at the expense of the horse's foot.
Each foot requires treating with full knowledge of the form
best adapted to its natural formation, and most capable of
carrying a shoe.</p>


<p class="p2"><b>The Instruments</b> used to prepare a foot for shoeing
are a rasp, a drawing knife, and a toeing knife.</p>

<p>The rasp is the most indispensable. It should be sixteen
inches long, proportionately broad, and one part of it
should be a file-surface. The shorter, narrow rasps do
not afford all the advantages a farrier should possess to enable
him to do the best work. To strike an even all-round level
bearing surface on a hoof a farrier requires a large rasp, just
as a joiner must have a large plane to produce a level surface
on wood. Harm may be done by the careless use of a rasp,
and a bearing-surface spoiled by the over-reduction of horn
at one place. This fault may be aggravated by attempts to
mend it, if such attempt take the form of further reduction
of the whole hoof on a foot where horn is deficient.</p>

<p>The drawing knife is a comparatively modern instrument
which replaced a tool called the buttress. A drawing
knife is formed with great skill for the purpose of paring
out the concave sole of the hoof, and has done infinite harm.
In the days which have now almost passed away, when it was
thought the proper thing to make the hoof look clean, smooth,
and pretty, the drawing knife was the chief instrument in
the preparation of the foot. Now, when nearly all men
know that the stronger the sole and frog of the foot can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
preserved the better for the horse, this knife is less used&mdash;and
the less the better. The doorman, preparing a foot for the
fireman to fit a shoe to, should not use a knife at all. The
man who fits the shoe requires a knife to remove occasional
little prominences of horn which are liable to cause uneven
pressures or which are in the way of a properly fitted shoe&mdash;as,
for instance, the edge of the wall to make way for a clip,
or the angle of sole at the heel to prevent uneven pressure
by the shoe.</p>

<p>The toeing knife usually consists of about a foot of an
old sword-blade. This knife is held and guided by one hand
of the farrier, whilst with the other it is driven through
overgrown horn by the hammer. Skilfully used it is unobjectionable,
and for the large strong hoof of heavy draught
horses it saves a great deal of time and labour. For the
lighter class of horses it is unnecessary, and for weak feet
with a thin horn covering it is dangerous.</p>

<p>The toeing knife cannot leave a finished level bearing
surface, and its work has to be completed by a few strokes of
the rasp. A farrier should, therefore, never attempt to
remove all the superfluous horn with the knife, he should
leave some for the rasp so that in producing the final level
surface no encroachment upon the necessary thickness of
covering horn need be made.</p>

</div>


<p class="p2"><b>The overgrown foot</b> such as we find on a healthy
horse that has retained a set of shoes for some weeks, or
that has been without shoes on a surface not hard enough
to cause sufficient wear, is quite unfitted to receive a shoe.
It must be reduced to proportions. In <a href="#Fig018">Fig. 18</a>, I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>attempted to show diagrammatically a side view of an overgrown
hoof. The dotted lines at the base show two effects of
lowering one part more than another, although both attain a
level surface. In <a href="#Fig021">Fig. 21</a> we see the result of over-lowering the
heels, and in <a href="#Fig020">Fig. 20</a> of leaving them too high. It may also be
noticed that these conditions affect other parts of the foot; in fact
not only other parts but the whole foot, and even the relative
position of the foot to the leg. If we compare the proportionate
foot, <a href="#Fig019">Fig. 19</a>, with the diagram <a href="#Fig021">Fig. 21</a>, it will
be seen that by over-lowering the heels the slope of the front
of the foot is increased, that the bearing surface from heel
to toe is slightly increased in length, and that if the dotted
perpendicular line be accepted as showing the direction
through which the weight of the body passes, lowering the
heels tends to put an increased proportion of weight on the
back parts of the foot. If we compare <a href="#Fig019">Fig. 19</a> with <a href="#Fig020">Fig. 20</a>
we see the effect of leaving the heels too high. The bearing
surface from heel to toe is shortened, the slope of the wall
at the toe is made less, and more weight is thrown upon the
front parts of the foot.</p>

<p>Now these alterations in both cases affect not only the
form of the foot but its relative position to the leg, and
as the bones of the limb above are a series of levers connected
by muscles and ligaments so placed as to be most efficient
for movement, it is evident that alterations of the foot must
affect the action of the limb. (Compare <a href="#Fig019">Figs. 19</a>, <a href="#Fig020">20</a> and <a href="#Fig021">21</a>) In
the unshod horse roaming about there is a natural automatic
return to proper relative position whenever it has been
temporarily upset. A long toe is worn down and high heels
are reduced to their proper level by friction. Not so a
foot protected by an iron shoe. Wear is stopped, and a
disproportionate hoof becomes more and more disproportionate.
Temporary alterations of the position of the
foot do little harm because they are permitted, within a
margin, by the movement of joints and by the elasticity of
muscles. When, however, an alteration of position is
continued for many weeks it tends to become permanently
fixed and may thus do a great deal of harm, which is not
traced to its real cause because the effect is slow and gradual.
It is important, therefore, to remember that the proportion
of the hoof is to be maintained not only because it is
necessary to the well-being of the foot; but because it affects
the action of the whole limb. Too long a toe may cause
a horse to stumble, and it must always increase the strain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>on the back tendons during progression. Heels too high
prevent the frog from taking its proper bearing on the
ground, and thus cause a loss of function in the back parts
of the foot. An excessively high heel has a tendency to
throw the knee forward and to straighten the pastern.</p>

<p>It is impossible to lay down any hard and fast rule to
guide a farrier in maintaining the proportions of heel and toe
when reducing an overgrown hoof to proper form. Feet
differ much in their natural formation, some are high-heeled
and some low, some are straight in front some very much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>sloped, some are narrow and upright, others round and
spreading. In <a href="#Fig022">Fig. 22</a> the heels are too high, and the
bearing surface does not reach the transverse line at the
heels. The side view shows the excessive height of heels
and the slope of the wall in front too upright. Great
assistance is afforded the farrier in judging whether he
should remove more horn from heel or toe by the appearance
of the under surface of the foot. When the heels
are much above the level of the frog there is an indication<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
for their lowering. When the wall and bars are about flush
with the angle of sole between them, there is, as a rule, no
more horn to spare at that part. The length of the toe
may be usefully gauged by the condition of the junction
between wall and sole. When the sole is sound and strong
all the wall above its level&mdash;wall unsupported by sole and
showing on its inner aspect marks of the horny laminæ&mdash;may
be rasped down so that a firm bearing surface is obtained
consisting of wall and sole.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Fig023">Fig. 23</a> the bearing surface at the heels is below
the line marking a proportionate foot. The toe is too long
and projects beyond the transverse toe line. The side view
shows the low heel and the corresponding excess in the
slope of the wall in front. The lower transverse line in
each figure does not represent the ground, but is added to
make clear the height of heels and length of toe.</p>

<p>Important as it is to maintain the relative proportions
between the front and back parts of the foot, it is perhaps
even more important to preserve the balance between the
two sides of a foot. Both sides must be left of equal height.
If one side be higher than the other a disproportionate amount
of weight is thrown on the lower side, and more or less
strain is put upon the ligaments of the joint above. In
the <a href="#Fig024">Figs. 24</a> one limb is shown with both sides of the
hoof even, and the straight line of the limb cuts squarely
across the transverse line of the bearing surface of the foot.
In the the other limb one side of the hoof is too high,
and in the preparation for shoeing only that side will require
attention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>
<p>Through constant neglect of this point some feet become
more or less permanently twisted&mdash;and the twist occurs at
the coronet. The ground surface of a foot or a shoe always
tends to remain at right angles to the direction of the limb,
and when the sides of a hoof are allowed to remain of unequal
height, the higher side presses the soft tissues of the coronet
upwards. As the hoof grows from the coronet the side thus
increased in height is not so noticeably uneven at the lower
border of the wall as at its upper, and it cannot be restored
to its proper form, except by months of careful attention and
slight over-lowering at each shoeing. The diagrams (<a href="#Fig025">Figs.
25</a> and <a href="#Fig026">26</a>) represent vertical sections through a foot from
side to side. One shows the wall uneven at the base, the
other shows it uneven at the coronet.</p>

<p>Peculiarities in the formation of a limb sometimes cause an
apparent error in the relative position of the foot. Thus we
have horses that turn their toes in, and those that turn their
toes out. The cause of this twist takes place at the upper
part of the limb, and it will be found that when the toes turn
out the elbow turns in and <i>vice versâ</i>. The farrier can do no
good to this formation, and attempts to alter it or disguise it
by devices in shoeing are only injurious to the foot,&mdash;little
deceptions worthy of a horse-coper.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>


<p class="p2"><b>A good bearing surface</b> is the primary object aimed
at in preparing the foot for a shoe. The relative position of
the limb to the foot and the proper proportions of every part
of the foot are matters to be borne in mind whilst the farrier
is directly forming the bearing surface for a shoe. A good
bearing surface must be even, level, on sound horn, and as
wide as can be obtained to give stability to the shoe. It
should not be limited to the wall. If, without over-reduction,
the use of the rasp leaves a firm portion of the sole as a
level surface continuous with the lower edge of the wall, the
best of bearing surfaces is obtained. (<a href="#Fig027">Fig. 27</a>). The bearing
surface should be level from heel to toe, and no part of it
can be singled out either as unfit to bear weight or as
specially capable of enduring undue pressure. No broken
or diseased horn should be used as bearing surface for a shoe.
The broken horn should be removed and the diseased horn
must, if not entirely removed, have so much of its border
cut or rasped off as will prevent contact with a shoe.</p>


<p><a name="Fig027"></a></p>

</div>
</div>



<p>After forming a level bearing surface with the rasp the
sharp outer border of the wall is lightly removed with the
file, so as to prevent splitting of the horn. The outer surface
of the wall should not be rasped for it affords protection to
the deeper layer of horn. The harder the outer layer of horn
is kept the tougher and firmer is the whole thickness.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>


<p class="p2"><b>The Sole and Frog</b> require very little attention. No
sensible farrier now puts himself to the unnecessary trouble
of cutting away horn that is wanted for protection. It was
not the practical farrier that introduced the stupid "paring
and cutting" that ruined horses' feet for nearly a century.
It was the theorists, who taught expansion of the wall and
descent of the sole as primary necessities in the function of a
foot, who must be credited with all the evils resulting from
robbing the sole and frog of horn. When a horse is shod
with an iron shoe the wall cannot wear, and therefore it
has to be artificially reduced at each shoeing. But the
shoe does not interfere with the wear of a frog, and the
farrier may safely leave that organ entirely to take care of
itself. To some extent the shoe does interfere with the
natural wear of the sole, and, therefore, any flakes of horn
which have been prevented by the shoe from detaching
themselves from the sole may be removed. The best way
to remove these is with the buffer. The sole should not be
pared out. I mean not only that the horn should be left
strong, it should not be pared with a drawing knife, even if
only a harmless surface layer be removed. The effect of
leaving the sole of a shod foot with a smooth, level, pared
surface is to stop its natural method of throwing off more
or less broken flakes, and to cause it to retain that which is
half loose until it is removed in one great cake.</p>

<p>A portion of the sole that requires a little special care
in preparing for shoeing is the angle between the wall and
the bars&mdash;the well-known seat of "corn." This must not be
left so as to come in contact with the shoe. It is not to be
"scooped" out, but it should be reduced distinctly below the
level of the wall so that when the shoe has been in position
for a week or two there is still no contact between the horn
of the soles and the iron at that point.</p>


<p class="p2"><b>Level or adjusted surface?</b> The bearing surface
of a hoof must, of course, be exactly adapted to the surface
of shoe intended to be applied. Presuming that the
best surface for a shoe is one level from toe to heel, I
have insisted upon the necessity of a level bearing surface
on the foot. There are, however, exceptional cases in
which a level shoe is not used, and then we must alter
the foot accordingly. Horses that wear the toe of a shoe
out of all proportion to the rest of the iron may be beneficially
shod with a shoe turned up at the toe. To fit such a shoe
the hoof surface must not be made level, it must be rasped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>away at the toe and rounded off to follow the line of the shoe.
In the three diagrams (<a href="#Fig028">Fig. 28</a>) is shown&mdash;(<i>a</i>) side view of a
foot prepared to suit the turned-up shoe at the toe, (<i>b</i>)
a level line to fit a level shoe and, (<i>c</i>) a form often adopted
on the Continent to suit a shoe fitted with a slight
curve throughout. This adjusted shoe is designed to imitate
the shape of the worn surface of an old shoe or to some
extent the worn surface of an unshod foot. Every farrier
knows how many horses go better after a level shoe has been
worn a few days than when first applied, and it is argued,
with reason, that the greater ease is due to the shoe being
worn to the form offering least resistance to the movement
of the foot in locomotion. I have nothing to say against this
form of shoe and the necessary form of foot surface for it,
except that it is more difficult to make than the ordinary
level one. When adopted the curve of the foot should not be
obtained by over-lowering the toe and heels but by leaving
the quarters higher.</p>

</div>




<h3 class="no-break"><span class="smcap">Faults to be avoided.</span></h3>

<p><a href="#Fig029">Fig. 29</a> shows a hoof in which shortening of the toe
has been effected not by reducing the ground surface of
the wall, but by rasping away the wall in front of the
toe. This should not be done with any good foot, but it
may be adopted with feet having an unnaturally long
toe and no superfluous horn on the under surface. A
"stumped-up" toe is very ugly and it weakens the hoof
in front.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">Fig. 29.&mdash;A "stumped-up" toe.</p>
</div>
</div>




<p class="p2"><b>Uneven bearing surfaces</b> are easily produced by a
careless use of the rasp. One side of the wall may be made
lower than the other, one heel may be reduced more than
the rest of the foot, or one side of the toe may be unevenly
reduced. In <a href="#Fig030">Fig. 30</a> the foot presents an uneven surface
which not uncommonly results from careless work. The parts
over-reduced are those most easily reached with a rasp. The
near foot suffers at the outside heel and inside toe. The off
foot at the inside heel and outside toe. A left handed farrier
would injure the feet in just the opposite positions.</p>




<p><a name="Fig030"></a></p>

</div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>
<p>Another fault results from holding the rasp untruly. If
we suppose the inside heel of the near foot to be under preparation
and the farrier inclines his rasp too much inwards,
he leaves the wall at the heel lower than the sole within it.
On such a foot a level shoe rests upon the sole instead of
upon the wall, and a bruised heel soon follows.</p>


<p class="p2"><b>Paring away the sole</b> to produce a deep concave appearance
has another evil effect in addition to that before
pointed out. It removes the horn just within the border of
the wall, taking away the natural support, and leaving as
bearing surface for a shoe a narrow ridge instead of a strong
flat surface. <a href="#Fig031">Fig. 31</a> shows this fault, and it must be remembered
that this ridge may be left as thin as a knife edge.
Such a ridge cannot sustain the weight of the horse, and
when it yields the shoe also yields, the clenches are raised and
the shoe becomes loose.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">Fig. 31.&mdash;A Pared-out Sole.</p>
</div>
</div>



<p class="p2"><b>Excessive rasping of Wall.</b> The best farriers&mdash;those
most proud of their work&mdash;have a great temptation to use
a rasp too freely to the outer surface of the wall. The hoof
gets rough, or it may be ridged, its appearance is improved
by being made smooth, and it is only human to turn out
work which is clean and neat. Owners and grooms are
rather inclined to forget the claims of the horse when judging
shoeing, and the result is that some harm is done by excessive
rasping. A strong foot does not suffer much, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
its strength is preserved by leaving the hard outer surface
intact. Rasping off an outer layer of horn favours evaporation
and hardening of the underneath layer, and the toughness
so desirable is to some degree replaced by hardness and
brittleness. Excessive rasping below the clenches is even
more injurious than rasping above them. The wall, between
its bearing surface and the clenches, has to withstand the
contact of the shoe, and the perforation by nails. It should
be the toughest and strongest part, and, therefore, should not
be rasped more than is necessary to lay down the clenches
and finish the fitting. Unfortunately the neatest work is
done by fitting a shoe "close" and then rasping off any
protruding horn. This is bad for the foot, as it weakens the
wall and spoils the bearing surface at each shoeing. The
worst offenders in this direction are dealers, who sacrifice
everything to appearances and insist upon shoeing being neat
at all hazards.</p>


<p class="p2"><b>Opening the Heels</b> is one of the gravest faults a
farrier can be guilty of. It consists in cutting away the
extremity of the wall at the heel and generally a slice off the
side of the frog at the same time. The effect is to produce
an appearance of width at the back of the foot&mdash;to make what
is called "a fine open foot." <a href="#Fig031">Fig. 31</a> shows a foot which
has been injured in this way. The wedge shaped opening
which results has many objections. It breaks the continuity
of structures at the heels, it removes horn unnecessarily, it
weakens the foot and, when the wall is interfered with, it
shortens the bearing surface for a shoe. The bearing surface
at the back of the foot is perhaps the most important of any
afforded by the wall. The longer the bearing surface is at
the heels the more the base for sustaining weight is brought
under the leg, and the better the position for supporting the
body. All removal of horn that shortens this surface is
injurious.</p>


<p class="p2"><b>Over-reduction of hoof</b> is always a fault. It is true
a carefully fitted shoe on a foot so treated may do no
harm for a time. Too much horn should be left rather
than too little. A strong covering of horn is a protection
against many mistakes in the fitting or form of a shoe
applied to a foot. So long as a hoof is everywhere strong
enough to sustain pressure and afford bearing, weight is
evenly distributed throughout the whole foot. When the
horn is thin it yields to any uneven pressure and damage
is done to the foot, even if immediate lameness is not induced.</p>

<h2><a name="IV">CHAPTER IV.</a><br /><br />
<small><span class="smcap">The Form and Manufacture of Shoes.</span></small></h2>




<p>Horse-shoes are made either by hand or machinery. In
this country most are hand-made&mdash;the front shoes from new
bar-iron, and the hind from old shoes welded together and
drawn out under heavy hammers. Probably no method of
working iron gives such good results as this in producing a
hard, tough shoe that will withstand wear. The custom of
the trade is to keep a stock of shoes suitable for all the
regular customers. From this stock are selected sizes and
forms, which are then specially fitted for each foot.</p>

<p>Various materials have been tried in the production of
horse-shoes. Leather, compressed and hardened, has been
tried, and failed. Vulcanite was experimented with unsuccessfully.
Paper, or more correctly, a compressed <i>papier
maché</i>, has also been tested but proved unsatisfactory. Steel
has been pretty largely tried in many different forms, but it
is difficult to temper. As nearly all shoes are applied
immediately after being fitted they have to be rapidly cooled
in water, and steel treated in this way is made so hard that,
if the shoes do not break, they are dangerously slippery on
most paved streets. As a material for shoes good malleable
iron has no equal. It can be obtained in bars of various
sizes to suit any form and weight of shoe, and the old shoes
made from it may be worked up over and over again.</p>

<p>The chief objects to be attained in any particular pattern
or form of shoe are&mdash;that it be light, easily and safely
retained by few nails, capable of wearing three weeks or a
month, and that it afford good foot-hold to the horse. All
shoes should be soundly worked and free from flaws.</p>

<p>The first shoes were doubtless applied solely to protect the
foot from wear. The simplest arrangement would then be
either a thin plate of iron covering the ground surface of the
foot, or a narrow rim fixed merely round the lower border of
the wall. Experience teaches that these primitive forms can
be modified with advantage, and that certain patterns are
specially adapted to our artificial conditions. A good
workman requires no directions as to how he should work,
and it is doubtful if a bad one would be benefitted by any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
written rules, but it should be noted that a well-made shoe
may be bad for a horse's foot, whilst a very rough, badly-made
one may, when properly fitted, be a useful article. To make
and apply horse-shoes a man must be more than a clever
worker in iron&mdash;he must be a farrier, and that necessitates a
knowledge of the horse's foot and the form of shoe best
adapted to its wants.</p>


<p class="p2"><b>Weight of Shoes.</b> The lighter a shoe can be made
the better. Weight is a disadvantage we are obliged to put
up with to obtain wear, for the frequent removal of shoes is
only a little less injurious to the hoof than working with none
at all. It is not to be understood that the heaviest shoe gives
the most wear; on the contrary, a heavy shoe may have the
iron so distributed as to increase the rapidity of wear, and
a shoe of half the weight properly formed may last longer.
It is no uncommon thing to find worn-out shoes still weighing
more than a new shoe which will, on the same horse, give a
longer period of wear. When a horse wears his shoes out
very rapidly, the indication to the farrier is not simply to
increase the weight, but to see if he can obtain more wear by
altering the form and distributing the iron in a different way.
A tired horse wears his shoes much more rapidly than a fresh
and active one. Continued slipping wears away a shoe out of
all proportion to the work done by a horse having a firm foot-hold.
These two different conditions may be partially due to
the shoes, for a heavy shoe tires the leg, and broad flat shoes
favour slipping. Some horses wear one special part of the
shoe excessively&mdash;as a rule, either at the toe or the heel&mdash;and
this is better met by turning up the worn part out of the
line of wear than by thickening it and so increasing weight.
Besides, a heavy shoe requires a greater number or a larger
size of nails to retain it securely in position, and this is a
disadvantage. It has often been asserted that a horse "goes
better" in a heavy shoe than a light one, and that this is due
to the heavier shoe acting as a protection to the foot and
warding off concussion. If the term "goes better" merely
means that he lifts his foot higher and consequently bends his
knee more, I do not deny the assertion. The reason of this
is not that the horse feels less concussion and therefore goes
freer. It is an exaggeration of the natural movements, due
simply to the horse with weight imposed on his feet having
to use the muscles of his arms more to lift that weight. The
same thing can be brought about by tying bags of shot on to
the hoof, which is done to cultivate "action." The healthy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
foot requires no artificial aids against concussion, but when a
foot becomes tender from bad shoeing it may sometimes be
relieved by adding to the substance and weight of a shoe.</p>

<p>The following are about the average weights, per shoe, of
horses standing 16 hands high:</p>

<p class="p2"><b>Thickness and Width of Shoes.</b> To obtain the
necessary amount of wear from shoes they must be increased
either in thickness or width, and it will assist us in estimating
the relative value of these conditions if we shortly consider
their advantages and disadvantages. I may say at once that
no sound foot requires a wide shoe merely as "cover" or
protection for the sole. Defective soles may sometimes require
protection, but sound ones never, and we may therefore put
aside entirely all claims made for width of shoe under pretence
that it gives a valuable protection to the foot. A shoe should
be as wide as the natural bearing surface of the foot, so that
it may occupy the whole of the space offered by nature as
useful for bearing. Even when it is wider no harm is done
until the width is such as to afford a lodgement for stones, etc.,
between the concave sole and the web of the shoe.</p>

<p>A thick shoe raises the foot from the ground and thus
removes the frog from bearing&mdash;a very decided disadvantage.
It also requires the larger sizes of nails to fill up the deep
nail holes, and very often renders the direction of the nail
holes a matter of some difficulty.</p>

<p>The width of a shoe may beneficially vary. It should be
widest at the toe to afford increased surface of iron where
wear is greatest. It should be narrowest at the heels so as
not to infringe upon the frog, nor yet to protrude greatly
beyond the level of the wall. The thickness of a shoe should
not vary unless, perhaps, it be reduced in the quarters.
Heel and toe should be of the same thickness so as to preserve a
level bearing. Excess of thickness at the toe puts a strain
on the back tendons, whilst excess at the heels tends to
straighten the pastern.</p>


<p class="p2"><b>The surfaces of Shoes.</b> There are two surfaces of
the shoe which claim attention, one which is applied to
the foot, and another which rests on the ground. The form
of these surfaces may be varied greatly, but of course the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
foot-surface presents much less necessity and less opportunity
for alterations than the ground-surface. The foot-surface of
a shoe must be formed in accordance with the requirements
of the horse's foot, and no other consideration should be
allowed to materially modify it. The ground-surface may be
altered to suit the tastes and prejudices of the owner as well
as the requirements of the horse and the peculiarity of roadways.</p>



<p><a name="Fig032"></a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 50%" >
<img src="images/051.jpg" alt="" style="width: 80%" />
<div class="caption">
<p class="center">Fig. 32.&mdash;A level, flat bearing-surface.</p>
</div>
</div>



<p class="p2"><b>The Foot-Surface.</b> It is quite obvious that the
surface of the shoe upon which the hoof has to rest should
be regular and even; that it should not consist of hills and
holes or grooves and ridges. I should not have mentioned
such a very evident matter but that in large towns, the
cheaper and poorer classes of shoeing commonly possess this
very fault. When shoes are made from thin, wide, old iron
tyres they are "buckled" on one surface, and to hide this the
farrier puts that side to the foot so that it is not noticed until
it causes damage. There are three or four forms of foot-surface
adopted by farriers, all of which have distinctive
features, and some of which have very grave evils. There is
the plain flat surface which is given to all narrow shoes, to
hunting shoes, and to some heavier and wider shoes. So
long as the sole is healthy and arched this is a very good
form. All hind shoes have a flat foot-surface, and most fore
shoes might have it with advantage. It utilises the whole of
the natural bearing surface, and must of necessity afford a
firmer basis for the foot to rest upon than a more limited
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>surface. The fore feet are not so constantly arched in the
sole as the hind. Sometimes they are flat and occasionally
convex. If a shoe be intended for use on all feet&mdash;on feet
with convex and flat soles as well as those properly formed&mdash;a
wide flat foot surface would often cause injury by pressing
unevenly upon the sole. To avoid this injury in less than
five per cent of feet, and to save the trouble of keeping in
stock shoes of different forms, the flat foot-surface of front
shoes has been replaced by a bevelled or "seated" surface.
(<a href="#Fig033">Fig. 33</a>).</p>


<p><a name="Fig033"></a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 50%" >
<img src="images/052.jpg" alt="" style="width: 80%" />
<div class="caption">
<p class="center">Fig. 33.&mdash;A "seated" bearing surface.</p>
</div>
</div>



<p>This form is very widely used. It consists of a narrow
flat surface next the outer circumference of the shoe, about equal
in width to the border of the wall, and within that, of a
bevelled surface, sloped off so as to avoid any pressure on a
flat sole. This "seated" surface is not positively injurious
but it limits the bearing to the wall, and neglects to utilise
the additional bearing surface offered by the border of the
sole. If shoes were to be made all alike no shoe is so
generally useful and safe as one with a foot-surface of this
form, but it is evident that when the sole of the foot is
concave there is nothing gained by making half the foot-surface
of the shoe also concave.</p>

<p>There are two other forms of foot-surface on shoes.
In one the surface slopes gradually from the outer to the inner
edge of the shoe, like the side of a saucer. In the other the
incline is reversed and runs from the inner edge downwards
to the outer. This last form is not often used, and was
invented with the object of spreading or widening the foot to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>which it was attached. The inventor seemed to think that
contraction of a foot was an active condition to be overcome
by force, and that expansion might be properly effected by a
plan of constantly forcing apart the two sides of the foot.
The usual result of wearing such a shoe is lameness, and it
achieves no good which cannot be as well reached by simply
letting the foot alone.</p>

<p>The foot-surface which inclines downwards and inwards
like a saucer acts in an exactly opposite way to the other.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>The wall cannot rest on the outer edge of the shoe, and consequently
falls within it, the effect being that at every step the
horse's foot is compressed by the saucer-shaped bearing. This
form of surface (<a href="#Fig035">Fig. 35</a>) is frequently seen, and is at all times
bad and unnecessary. Even when making a shoe for the
most convex sole it is possible to leave an outer bearing
surface, narrow but level, which will sustain weight without
squeezing the foot.</p>


<p><a name="Fig036"></a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 50%" >
<img src="images/054.jpg" alt="" style="width: 80%" />
<div class="caption">
<p class="center">Fig. 36.&mdash;Foot-surface level at Heels.</p>
</div>
</div>



<p>At the heels the foot-surface of all shoes should be flat&mdash;not
seated&mdash;so that a firm bearing may be obtained on the
wall and the extremity of the bar. No foot is convex at the
heels, therefore there is no excuse for losing any bearing
surface by seating the heels of a shoe to avoid uneven pressure.
<a href="#Fig036">Fig. 36</a> rather exaggerates the "unseated" portion
of shoe.</p>


<p class="p2"><b>The Ground-Surface.</b> As I have said, this may vary
indefinitely. Sometimes it is a plain flat surface, broken
only by the holes made for nails or by the "fullering" which
affords not only space for the nails but some grip on the
ground. When a shoe is "fullered" the groove made should
be deep, so as to let the nail-head well down, and wide so as
to afford room for giving the nail a proper direction. If the
fullering be continued round the toe of a shoe by a good
workman neatness is given, but when a clip is drawn the iron
is so reduced that some wear is sacrificed. If only an inch
at the toe be unfullered, the solid iron affords more wear just
where it is wanted.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">Fig. 37.&mdash;Concave ground-surface.</p>
</div>
</div>



<p>The concave shoe, often described as a hunting-shoe, presents
a very different ground-surface from that just referred
to. It rests upon two ridges with the fullering
between, and on the inner side of these the iron is suddenly
sloped off. This shoe is narrow and flat on the foot-surface,
and is specially formed to give a good foot-hold and
to be secure on the hoof.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">Fig. 38.&mdash;Double-grooved ground-surface.</p>

</div>



<p>A Rodway shoe has two longitudinal grooves and three ridges
on its ground-surface. The outer groove carries the nails,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>and the inner groove lightens the shoe and increases the foot-hold.
It is not the number of grooves or ridges that prevents
slipping; it is the absence of a continuous flat surface of
iron, and the existence of irregularities which become filled up
with sand and grit. A four-grooved shoe has no more
anti-slipping properties than a three-grooved, and a one-grooved
shoe is as good as either, although it cannot stand
the same amount of wear.</p>

<p>Transverse ridges and notches have also been tried as
ground-surfaces for shoes, but offer very little, if any, better
grip than the longitudinal grooves. Their great disadvantage
is that they cannot be made deep enough without weakening
the shoe, whilst if shallow they are worn out before the shoe
has been long in wear.</p>

<p class="p2"><b>A Calkin</b> is the name given to the extremity of a shoe
when turned down at the heels. Calkins are used on most
hind shoes and, in some parts of the country, on fore shoes.
They are supposed to be the most convenient and effective
means of giving good foot-hold. This supposition is correct
when a horse travels on soft ground or on streets so paved
that a space is left between each course of stones. They are
of very little use on asphalte or wood pavement, and not much
more use on roller-made macadam. With light modern carriages
and level modern roads calkins are quite unnecessary, and
better means of giving foot-hold may be substituted. It is a
fact that horses when shoes are new and calkins prominent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>do their work without slipping, and that when the calkins are
worn down the horse moves with less confidence and security.
This does not prove that calkins are necessary. It must
be remembered that horses possess a power of adapting
themselves to circumstances, but having learned to rely upon
any artificial assistance they are the more helpless, for a time,
on its withdrawal. Calkins assist the horse for a time, but
after the calkin is worn down the horse is in a worse
position than if he had never become accustomed to its
assistance. Of course on soft ground, especially grass,
calkins afford a firmer grip than any other contrivance.
On the other hand, their constant use lifts the frog
out of bearing and causes it to waste, thus spoiling the
action of the natural provision against slipping. Level shoes
on the hind feet promote sound, prominent frogs, and
give firm foot-hold for all light horses. Even omnibus
horses, now that the vehicles are supplied with effective foot-brakes,
may advantageously be worked without calkins. On
country roads, especially when the district is hilly or the load
is heavy, calkins may be requisite, and must then be made to
do as little harm as possible.</p>

<p>The wear of a shoe is affected by the height of a calkin.
The more the heel is raised the greater the amount of wear at
the toe. Many shoes when worn out at the toe show very
little effects of wear at other parts, and the question arises
how best to increase the wear of the shoe without increasing
its weight. In <a href="#Fig039">Fig. 39</a> three diagrams are presented in which
dotted lines show the effect of wear. At (<i>a</i>) the shoe is of
even thickness throughout&mdash;from heel to toe&mdash;and the line of
wear shows that when the shoe is worn out a great amount<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
of iron remains. At (<i>b</i>) the quarters of the shoe are made
thinner and the toe is made thicker, so that with no increase
of weight but by a better distribution of the iron, increased
wear is provided for at the part where it is most required.
At (<i>c</i>) is shown a shoe similar in form to that at (<i>b</i>) but
differently fitted. The toe is turned slightly upwards, and
the result is that a larger portion of iron is brought into
wear. In the case of very hard-wearing horses that scrape
out the toe of the ordinary shoe in ten or fourteen days this
form of fitting adds considerably to the durability of the
shoe, and so preserves the foot from the evil of too frequent
removal of shoes, whilst avoiding any increase of weight.
Without calkins wear is more evenly distributed, and the
toe is not worn away disproportionately to the rest of
the shoe.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">Fig. 40.&mdash;Two calkins&mdash;the low square one preferable.</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>A calkin throws the leg and foot, to some extent, out
of their proper position. A very high calkin is not only
objectionable, it is unnecessary. Not much prominence is
required to afford a catch or stop. Excessive height is
usually given to meet wear, and this can be obtained equally
well by increasing the width and breadth. I, therefore,
recommend that when calkins are used they should be low,
square and broad. The further under a foot the calkin
is placed, the greater is the raising of the heel, therefore
calkins should always be accompanied by a long shoe.
The further back a calkin be placed the less it interferes
with the natural position of the foot.</p>

<p>Calkins render a horse liable to tread the opposite foot, and
the higher and sharper the calkin the greater the injury inflicted.
To avoid this injury the inner heel of a shoe frequently has
no calkin, but is made at the same level as the outer by
narrowing and raising the iron at the heel, forming what is
called a wedge heel. This is not an advisable form of shoe
as it has on the inner heel a skate-shaped formation, most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
favourable to slipping, and on the outer a catch&mdash;an arrangement
tending to twist the foot each time the catch takes hold
of the ground. If calkins are used at all they should be of
equal height and on both heels of the shoe.</p>

<p>In Scotland, and in the North of England, heavy horses are
shod, fore and hind, not only with calkins but also with toe-pieces,
and the owners assert that the horses could not do the
work without them. That horses do similar work in the
South without calkins and toe-pieces rather shakes one's
faith in the assertion, but it must be remembered that nearly
all paved streets in the North have a division left between
the rows of stones in which the toe-piece finds a firm resisting
surface. I believe also that the average load drawn is
greater in the North than in the South. One thing in favour of
toe-pieces must be acknowledged&mdash;they, with the calkins,
restore the natural position of the foot and preserve the level
of the shoe. On the larger draught horses the toe-pieces
permit a lighter shoe to be used, as the portion of iron between
heels and toe need not be thick to resist wear. It only
requires to be strong enough to support weight and much
less iron is therefore used.</p>

<p>The heavy dray horse of the North, shod with toe-pieces
and calkins, is never worked at a trot. In London all horses
are trotted&mdash;a proceeding which reflects discredit upon the
intelligence of the managers.</p>

<p>I must mention another objection to calkins. They increase
the tendency to "cut," and many horses will cease
"cutting" after calkins are removed and a level shoe has
been adopted.</p>


<p class="p2"><b>Nails and nail holes.</b> It is necessary to consider these
together as they are dependent on each other. Shoes were
first nailed to the feet by flat-headed nails, and probably it was
a long time before the wedge-headed nail was thought of.
When the nail head fits into the nail hole it may retain
the shoe till it is worn as thin as a penny, but if only the
shank of the nail enters the shoe, the head is soon worn off and
the shoe becomes loose. Within the last 20 years the horse-shoe
nail trade has been revolutionised by the introduction of
machinery. Machine-made nails are now almost entirely
used, and the three or four leading brands are as near
perfection as were the very best hand-made. Practically there
is no fault to find with them, and as they are ready-pointed
for driving they save time and labour in the forge. They are
made in various sizes, and numbered from 2 up to 16. Only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>the very best iron can be used to produce good nails.
Nothing is dearer than bad nails which cause injury to the
foot and loss of shoes.</p>


<p><a name="Fig041"></a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 80%" >

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">Fig. 41.</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>A good nail should present certain forms of head, neck
and shank. The head should not be too broad at the top or
it may become fixed in the nail-hole only by its upper edge,
as shown in the middle diagram <a href="#Fig041">Fig. 41</a>, and when the
shoe has had a few days wear the nail loses its hold,
and the shoe is loose. The neck should not be too thick,
as it is then liable to press on the sensitive foot and to
break the wall. The shank should not be too wide or too
thick. The point should not be too long or too tapered as
this leaves insufficient metal to form a good clinch.</p>

<p>There are two methods of putting nail-holes into shoes&mdash;by
"fullering" and by "stamping." A stamped shoe is one
in which the nail holes are merely punched at certain
distances, so as to leave four-sided tapered holes of the exact
shape of a nail-head. A fullered shoe is one having a groove
round the circumference through which the nail-holes are
punched. Both processes, when well-done, admit of nails being
driven into the hoof with equal safety and ease.</p>

<p>Whether stamped or fullered, there are a few more important
points to remember about the nail-holes. The wall
is not of the same thickness throughout, but becomes thinner
towards the heels. The inner side of the foot is also somewhat
thinner and more upright than the outer. The safest
position, then, for the nails is in the front half of the foot,
but should this position not present sound horn they may
be placed further back. The danger of placing nails near
the heels is due entirely to the greater risk in driving
them through the thin horn. There need be no fear of
interfering with expansion.</p>

<p>The distance of the nail-holes from the outer edge of the
shoe should depend upon the thickness of the horn of the wall,
and therefore be greater in large shoes than in smaller, and
greater at the toe than at the heels of the same shoe. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
the nail-holes are all near to the circumference of the
shoe (<a href="#Fig042">Fig. 42</a> <span class="smcap">B.</span>) they are described as "fine"; when they
are all placed far from the edge (<a href="#Fig042">Fig. 42</a> <span class="smcap">A.</span>) they are called
"coarse." When the nail-holes are too "fine" a nail has to
be driven high up in the wall to obtain a firm hold, and
this is liable to split the horn. When nail-holes are too
"coarse" the nail in driving goes dangerously near the sensitive
foot. The evils of coarse and fine nailing depend a great
deal upon the method of fitting the shoes. When shoes are
fitted full to the foot (when the outer circumference of the
shoe is greater than the circumference of the wall) "coarse"
nail-holes are brought to about their best position. When
shoes are fitted close (<i>i.e.</i>, when their outer edge is brought
within the border of the wall) "fine" nail-holes are brought
to their best position in relation to the foot. It need hardly
be added that the fit of a shoe ought not to be subject to the
position of the nail-holes, but that these should be properly
placed so that fitting be guided only by the requirements
of the foot.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">Fig. 42.&mdash;Wrongly placed Nail-holes.</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>Each nail-hole when properly placed&mdash;neither too coarse
nor too fine&mdash;should be punched straight through the shoe and
not inclined either inwards or outwards, except at the toe
where the slope of the wall is followed by slightly pitching in.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
When a fuller is used the groove made should be wide; then the
farrier has more command over the direction of his nail. If
the nail-hole be pitched in, the nail must take that direction
and is liable to wound the foot. If the nail-hole be pitched
out, the nail is prevented from taking sufficient hold of the
horn.</p>


<p><a name="Fig043"></a></p>

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">Fig. 43.&mdash;Nail-holes "pitched" in and out.</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>The position and direction of the nail-hole control the
passage of a nail through a shoe and into the hoof. The
man who drives a nail is usually blamed for laming a horse,
but in most cases it would be more just to blame the man
who made the nail-holes or fitted the shoe and so rendered
safe driving difficult or impossible.</p>

<p>Each nail-hole should be as far as possible from the other&mdash;say,
from an inch to an inch and a half apart. When the
two front or toe nail-holes are put too far back the whole are
crowded, or the last are pushed back too near the heels.</p>

<p>For small shoes four or five nail-holes are sufficient.
Medium-sized shoes should have from five to seven, and the
heavy shoes of big draught horses must have eight. The
number of nail-holes need not always be increased in proportion
to the size of the shoe, because as the weight of shoe is
increased so is the size of the nail, and an extra strong nail
may take the place of additional ones. The fewer nails in a
foot the better, but as a properly-placed nail does no harm,
and as the loss of a shoe may be very serious, it is better to
have one too many than one too few.</p>

<p class="p2"><b>Machine-made Shoes.</b> Horse-shoeing is distinctly
an art requiring special skill for its proper performance.
It is also one of the most laborious of all skilled trades.
Anything which lightens mechanical toil tends to improve
the mental and artistic qualities of the workman, and all
applications of machinery which lessen the heavy manual
labour of the farrier may therefore be looked upon as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>improvements. Machinery has lightened the labour of
shoe-making in two ways&mdash;by supplying various patterns of
grooved and bevelled iron in bars, which only require cutting
into lengths and turning round to form a shoe, and also by
making shoes all ready to be fitted to the foot. Machinery
has not yet turned out a shoe as good and durable and well
finished as the best workman can produce by hand, but it can
produce many forms of shoes as good for all practical purposes,
and it has this advantage&mdash;all are alike. Bad workmen
make bad shoes, but a machine, once able to produce a
good model, can repeat it exactly, therefore machine-made
shoes of a proper pattern are superior to all but the very best
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>hand-made shoes. Economy, of course, is on the side of the
article produced by machinery, and all large firms keeping
their own farriers find a great saving by buying the ready-made
shoes. Under conditions when shoes must be fitted
without a fire, as in coal mines, or in the case of armies during
a campaign, the machine-made article has the advantages of
regularity of form and a true level bearing surface.</p>

<p>In little shops where often only one man is at work, either
machine-made shoes or prepared bar iron offer great conveniences.
The prepared bars can be bought seated on the
foot-surface and with a single or double groove on the
ground-surface. Very narrow bars suitable for tips,
"Charlier," or light hack shoes are now widely used, and a
special bar&mdash;flat on the foot-surface, concave to the ground&mdash;can
be obtained which only requires cutting into lengths and
turning round to form a first-class hunting-shoe.</p>

<p>Both prepared bars and machine-made shoes must be
judged by their form and by the material used in their
manufacture. Some are better than others, but all have to
contend with a large amount of trade prejudice which has
little basis except in the matter of the hind shoes&mdash;here
machinery has not yet reached perfection.</p>

<h2><a name="V">CHAPTER V.</a><br /><br />
<small><span class="smcap">Selection of Shoes.</span></small></h2>


<p>In practice, a farrier does not trouble much about the
selection of suitable shoes. The rule is to apply whatever
form of shoe the horse has been wearing, and only to venture
an opinion as to alterations when asked by the owner. When
the selection of a suitable shoe is left to the workman he
takes into consideration the work required of the horse, the
form of the feet, and the wear of the old shoes. The form of
the old shoes indicates not only whether a horse is a light or
hard wearer but what parts of the shoe are most worn, and thus
enables provision to be made against excessive or irregular
wear. The form of the feet indicates not only what size of
shoe is requisite but also what special weakness or strength
is to be encountered. It is also necessary to note the condition
of the fetlocks and knees, which may show signs of
"brushing" or "speedy cutting." According to all these
appearances a shoe should be selected. For the different classes
of horse there are well-known forms of shoe which present
special advantages, thus:&mdash;</p>


<p class="p2"><b>The race horse</b> when in training, may be shod with
a very light shoe, but on the turf he requires the lightest
contrivance capable of protecting the hoof and affording
good foot-hold. The ordinary racing plate answers these
requirements. It is made in a "crease," or tool, or may be
made from specially prepared bars which only need cutting
into lengths and turning round. The plate is about one-third
of an inch wide by one-eighth thick. The foot-surface is flat,
and the ground-surface is fullered and concave.</p>


<p class="p2"><b>Steeplechase</b> plates are made on the same pattern, but
should be a little stronger so as to avoid even the possibility
of becoming twisted on the foot.</p>


<p class="p2"><b>Hunting shoes</b> should be light, very secure, and of
a form to give good foot hold. The best are flat on the
foot-surface, and fullered and concave on the ground-surface.
The hind shoe should also be concave on the ground-surface,
but to avoid the injury of over-reaching the inner circumference
at the toe should be rounded and smooth. A small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
square calkin at each heel affords grip on grass, and especially
in going down hill at a fast pace.</p>


<p class="p2"><b>Hacks</b>, being used on hard roads, must have heavier shoes
than hunters, but the form may be the same.</p>


<p class="p2"><b>Carriage horses</b> require more substance in their shoes
than hacks, and the narrow concave shoes suitable for
hunters and hacks cannot give sufficient durability. The
double-grooved shoe known as "Rodway's" is the best for
this class. On ordinary roads the hind feet may be shod
with a common two heeled shoe, but on wood and asphalte
the heavier sizes of Rodway iron make a shoe that affords
very good foot hold and dispenses with the necessity for
calkins.</p>


<p class="p2"><b>Omnibus and Van horses</b> require stronger shoes to
meet the hard wear entailed by their work. The heavy
Rodway iron makes very suitable front shoes, but the hind
shoes must be solid with only a fullering for the nails or,
as many prefer, each nail-hole separately stamped. As a rule
the hind shoes of this class of horse have calkins on the outside
heel. If the vehicle in which they run is provided with
a foot-brake calkins are unnecessary, and the advantages of a
level shoe should be made use of. The advantages are&mdash;better
foot hold, longer wear and less danger from treads
and "cutting."</p>


<p class="p2"><b>Heavy draught horses.</b> In Scotland and in the
North of England this class of horse is shod with a toe-piece
and calkins on both fore and hind shoes. In London calkins
are only put on the hind shoes, and toe-pieces are not used
at all. On paved streets where a space exists between the
rows of stones and especially if the road be hilly, I think
toe-pieces are advisable, and of course when they are used
calkins must be also made. Horses having become accustomed
to toe-pieces, when shod with a level shoe, slip much more for
a week or two than do horses which have never learned to
rely upon the bar across the toe. Every thing considered, I
incline to prefer a level shoe in front, and a shoe with
two low square calkins behind for heavy draught horses.
The enormous width of shoe often used in London is
quite unnecessary, it is very heavy and it favours slipping.
A narrower shoe must of course be a little thicker to meet
the wear, but it is lighter and affords better foot hold,
and as slipping and fatigue are both causes of excessive
wear, a narrow shoe, weight for weight, will last longer than
a broad flat one.</p>

<h2><a name="VI">CHAPTER VI.</a><br /><br />
<small><span class="smcap">Fitting and Application of Shoes.</span></small></h2>


<p>Having selected shoes suitable for the feet and adapted to
the special work of the horse, having also prepared the foot
for shoeing, we arrive at another important part of the
farriers' art&mdash;fitting the shoe. No matter what form of
shoe be used or how the foot be prepared for it, unless the
two are properly fitted the horse does not obtain all the
advantages of good shoeing, and may be positively injured.
The owner of horses seldom knows anything about the
fitting of shoes, and therefore fails to appreciate how
some of his directions concerning feet and shoes are quite
impracticable.</p>


<p><a name="Fig048"></a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 65%" >
<img src="images/067.jpg" alt="" style="width: 80%" />
<div class="caption">
<p class="center">Fig. 48.</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>I have in a previous chapter attempted to show how a
foot should be prepared for shoeing, and what bearing surface
should be left for the shoe. I have also described what
I consider the best forms of shoe. The object at all times should
be to follow nature as closely as possible, but it often happens
that we may, with benefit, depart from the exact indications
given and still fulfil all essential requirements. If we examine
the unshod foot which has been worn down to proper
proportions we find the bearing surface is not level&mdash;it is
worn more at the toe and heels than elsewhere. If we
examine the ground surface of an old shoe the same thing is
noticed&mdash;the surface is not level, the toe and heel show most
wear. The question then arises, should we make the artificial
bearing surface of the foot on the same plan and adjust the
shoe to it, as in <a href="#Fig048">Fig. 48</a>, or should we make the surface
level and apply a level shoe as in <a href="#Fig049">Fig. 49</a>? I believe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>that the ideal arrangement would be to follow the line
suggested by a worn foot or a worn shoe, but it is difficult
to carry out, and greater exactness of fit is more readily
obtained by two level surfaces. The ground surface of a
shoe may, if necessary, be altered to suit the outline of wear,
whilst the level foot-surface is preserved, as in <a href="#Fig050">Fig. 50.</a></p>

</div>
</div>


<p>Whatever form the farrier adopts, a shoe should rest equally
throughout, and the contact of foot and shoe should be exact
over the whole bearing surface. Assuming then that a properly
prepared foot presents a level surface, the fitting of shoes becomes
simple so long as the smith possesses manual dexterity
and follows the indications of common sense.</p>

<p>There are two conditions to be fulfilled, (1) to fit the shoe
to the plain surface of the foot, (2) to fit the shoe to the circumference
of the wall. Most amateurs judge shoeing by
the way a shoe follows the outline of the hoof, but the practical
man knows that it is equally difficult and important to
fit the surface.</p>


<p class="p2"><b>Outline fitting.</b> A shoe is first compared with the foot, it
is then heated, and the heels cut off or turned down to the proper
length. Each limb of the shoe is fitted to follow the outline of
the wall, and it is necessary to warn the novice that the inside
and outside borders of a foot are not alike. The outside is
rounder and fuller, and the shoe should be shaped to follow
exactly the direction of the wall. The outer border of a shoe
should always be as prominent as the outer border of the
hoof; it should never be within it. The inner border must
not protrude beyond the wall lest the opposite leg be struck.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
A well fitted shoe must be fitted full to the foot. What
is called "close" fitting, <i>i.e.</i>, bringing the shoe rather within
the circumference of the wall, is injurious, as it loses the best
and strongest bearing of the wall, and permits the farrier
to give an appearance of neatness by rasping away any horn
which protrudes beyond the shoe. On a well-shaped foot
the shoe should follow the outer line of the hoof from toe
to heel, but where the heels of a foot are turned inwards there
is an advantage in fitting the shoe wider at the heels, as by
so doing the base of the foot is not constricted and a wider
resting surface is afforded to the limb. When a shoe is fitted
wide at the heels it is essential that the foot-surface of the
shoe should be level at the heels. If it be inclined, as it often
is in seated shoes, a very grave defect in the fitting results,
for the heels have no level bearing-surface.</p>

<p>A shoe fitted too wide is liable to be trodden off by the
opposite foot, or it may cause the horse to hit the opposite
fetlock joint.</p>

<p>Provided the nail holes are properly placed, when the
outside border of the shoe is fitted nicely to the circumference
of the hoof, they are brought to their right position. When
nail holes are placed too near, or too far, from the outer
border of the shoe&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, when they are too "fine" or
too "coarse"&mdash;it may be necessary to correct their position by
fitting the shoe "closer" or "fuller," as the case may be.
When a farrier fits shoes made by another man he may overlook
this, as we are all slaves to habit. The man who in his
daily practice combines "close" fitting with "fine" nailing
has to alter his routine when fitting a shoe with coarse nail
holes.</p>

<p>The length of a shoe at the heels is a matter of more
importance than is generally recognised. As a rule hunters
are all shod too short, while most cart horses are shod too
long. The objections to a long front shoe are that it is
liable to be trodden off by the hind shoe, and that it may
injure the elbow when the horse lies down. A long hind
shoe is free from both these disadvantages, and as it usually
has a calkin is the best form to adopt.</p>

<p>In fitting the heels of front shoes, in all but galloping
horses, the iron should generally extend slightly behind the extremity
of the horn. (<a href="#Fig048">Fig. 48</a>). Horses used for galloping should
have the end of the shoe just within the termination of the
horn, and should finish with an oblique extremity. (<a href="#Fig049a">Fig. 49</a>).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>There is nothing gained by greater shortening, if the iron be
fitted exactly to the horn. Why shoes are often pulled off,
when only just the length of the hoof, is because they are not
fitted close enough, and very often because they are wilfully
and ignorantly designed to leave a space between hoof and
iron. This so-called "eased" heel is an unmitigated evil.</p>

<p class="p2"><b>Surface-fitting.</b> It is simple to direct that the bearing-surface
of a shoe should be exactly adapted to the bearing-surface
of a foot. It is not so simple to carry out. When the
horn on the lower surface of a foot is thin any uneven pressure&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
pressure applied directly to one spot&mdash;soon causes
injury, pain, and lameness. When a good thick layer of horn
exists, uneven pressures are less injurious, because the horn
distributes them over a wide surface. Good workmanship
is displayed by leaving no uneven pressure, and by so fitting a
shoe that it shall do no harm. With a narrow shoe&mdash;one
only the width of the wall&mdash;no uneven pressure can be
applied to the sensitive foot, but such a shoe is seldom used
as it is too light to afford sufficient wear. A wide shoe
with a flat foot surface is easily fitted on all concave feet&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
on all hind and most fore feet. To make use of the
whole bearing-surface a shoe must rest evenly from toe to
heel&mdash;the flat surface of the shoe must take a level bearing
on the whole flat bearing-surface of the foot.</p>

<p>There are two places where injury from uneven pressure
is most likely to happen&mdash;at the toe and at the heels.</p>

<p>In preparing a foot the wall at the toe may, from want of
care, be reduced a little below the level of the sole, or in
making a shoe the inside border at the toe may be left higher
than the outside. In each case uneven pressure is placed on the
sole just where the back border of the shoe rests. In fitting
a hot shoe, wherever the hoof is unduly marked warning is
given that pressure at that point must be prevented by altering
the surface either of the shoe or the foot. On a strong
foot, the knife may be used to remove a little horn; on a
weak foot the alteration must be on the shoe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>At the the heel uneven pressure is most frequent on the
angle of sole between the wall and bar, where it causes the
so-called "corn"&mdash;a condition in the horse having no analogy to
the affliction similarly named in the human subject. It is
simply a bruise of the sensitive parts under the horn.</p>

<p>A bruised heel&mdash;a corn&mdash;is most likely to arise from the
use of a shoe too short, especially if fitted too close. It may
arise from a properly-fitted shoe retained too long on the
foot and shifted from its proper bearing on the wall to an
improper bearing on the sole. A bruised heel may also
result from the use of a well-made shoe if the preparation
of the hoof has been faulty. Rule-of-thumb directions to
"reduce the heels to a level by the use of the rasp, but on
no account cut away any sole" may result in injury. In
a strong foot with an overgrown sole it is easy to get
a level surface and to fit on to it a level shoe, but
the horn of the sole does not remain level. As it grows
and flakes off the portion between the bar and wall is raised.
If the weather be wet it swells, and then, bound down by the
shoe, it acts simply as a stone might and bruises the sensitive
parts within by its uneven pressure. It is always safe and it
is never injurious to remove so much of the surface of this
portion of sole with the drawing-knife as will ensure no
uneven pressure on it by the shoe.</p>

</div>
</div>



<p>The more exactly the shoe fits the foot-surface the more
easily it is retained in position by the nails, and the less likelihood
there is of any part of it pressing distinctly on a limited
portion of horn. Exact fitting allows all bearings and
pressures to be distributed equally over the surface of the
hoof, and thus permits the shoe most nearly to resemble a
mere continuation of the hoof in iron&mdash;an arrangement to
prevent wear, but not to interfere with natural functions.
There is one departure from level fitting which requires
special notice since it is made, not by accident or negligence,
but by design. It consists in taking the bearing of an inch
or an inch and a half of the extremity of a shoe off the foot.
(<a href="#Fig050a">Fig. 50</a>). It has been called "easing the heels," and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>space permits a knife-blade, sometimes even a pencil, to be
placed between the shoe and the foot. It is one of the very
worst practices that theory has forced into horse-shoeing.
Men who do it say "the heels won't stand pressure." I reply
they will stand all proper pressure, and a good deal more
than the quarters. But the practice does not relieve the
heels of pressure. If you examine a shoe fitted in this
way, after it has done a month's service, you will find it
sometimes polished bright, sometimes with a deep groove
worn into it. You may also test its bearing by raising the
foot from the ground and inserting between shoe and hoof a flat
bit of wood, then on releasing the foot and raising the
opposite one, you will find that the bearing is such that the
bit of wood cannot be removed. The "eased heel" does
not relieve the heels of pressure but, instead of constant
normal bearing, it permits a downward movement of the
back of the foot at each step&mdash;which is unnatural, and which
cannot occur in an unshod foot on a level surface. The
"eased heel" does more than this. It wastes a large extent
of good bearing-surface, and it concentrates pressure at one
point&mdash;where the shoe and foot meet&mdash;at the quarters. It
loses good bearing-surface where it is important to have it,
and unevenly throws extra weight on the quarters which
are the weakest parts of the wall. An "eased heel" has not
one single advantage, but it has every disadvantage which
misplaced ingenuity could contrive.</p>

<p class="center">Fig. 51.&mdash;Section of a seated shoe.</p>
</div>
</div>



<p>For flat feet a wide shoe with a flat foot-surface is unsafe
as there is liability to uneven pressure on the sole. For
such feet the safer form of foot-surface is one presenting a
level narrow bearing-surface round its outer border, from
which an inclined or bevelled surface continues the shoe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>inwards. (<a href="#Fig051">Fig. 51</a>) This form of shoe can be fitted to nearly any
kind of foot. To escape injury to a flat sole "seating out"
shoes is necessary, but the operation should always leave a
level bearing-surface for the wall. When a shoe is seated
from one side to the other so as to produce a saucer shaped
surface harm is done to the foot. Such a shoe presents no
level bearing-surface, and the weight of the horse pressing
the wall on an inclined plane causes the foot to be pinched
or compressed in a manner which soon causes lameness.
(<a href="#Fig052">Fig. 52</a>). A few years ago these shoes were too common,
and to make them still more injurious, the foot was pared out
from the centre to the circumference like a saucer, and the
two spoiled articles were fitted together. Their surfaces of
contact were two narrow ridges which even the most expert
workman could not fit without injury to the horse.</p>


<p><a name="Fig052"></a></p>

</div>
</div>



<p>In <a href="#Fig052">Fig. 52</a> a shoe with an inclined surface is applied to a
foot with a bearing-surface as wide as the wall but the only
contact is at the edges. The horn at the edge will yield, and
the hoof be pressed inwards as the weight of the animal
forces the foot into the saucer-shaped shoe. When the
bearing-surface of the foot, instead of being as wide as the
wall, is only a ridge, the horn yields more rapidly, the
clinches rise and the shoe becomes loose.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Fig053">Fig. 53</a> is shown a section of another shoe with an inclined
instead of a level surface, but the slope is from within
outwards. The effect of this is exactly the opposite of the
previous shoe. The wall is forced outwards, and if it does
not as a whole yield to the pressure the portion in contact
is broken. When this form of bearing-surface is adopted at
the heels of a shoe the two sides of the hoof are violently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>forced apart, and it has even been recommended as a means
of expanding the foot; but forcible expansion is both unnecessary
and dangerous.</p>

<p>Always regarding the shoe as an extension of the natural
hoof in a harder and more durable material, it is evident
that the most stability will be attained by the use of as wide
a bearing-surface of foot and shoe as is compatible with ease
and safety to the horse.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Fig054">Fig. 54</a> is shown a section of a narrow shoe which takes
a bearing over the whole extent of its foot-surface.</p>

</div>
</div>



<p>In <a href="#Fig056">Fig. 56</a> we have a model bearing-surface on the foot,
nearly twice the width of the wall, and we have a shoe with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>a flat foot-surface capable of using the whole bearing. Such
is the fitting of all hind shoes, and it might well be adopted
with advantage in all fore shoes on good feet.</p>


<p class="p2"><b>Clips</b> are thin projections drawn up from the outer border
of shoes for the purpose of giving greater security to their
position on a foot. On heavy cart horses the clips are sometimes
of great size and encourage the idea that the smith
looks upon them as designed to assist the nails to retain the
shoe on the foot. They should have no such purpose, their
use being merely to prevent the shoe shifting to one side. A clip
should not be narrow and high, it should be low and wide so
that its bearing is taken against the lower edge of the wall.
A high clip is a most serious danger when shoes get loose
and are trodden on by the horse. The usual position for
a clip is at the toe, but there are occasions when two clips&mdash;one
at each side of the toe&mdash;are used. On some shoes a clip is
placed at the outer quarter to prevent the shoe being displaced
inwards; this is more often required on hind shoes.
A clip at the toe affords some assistance in fitting a shoe
exactly, and it also affords steadiness to the shoe during the
driving of the first nails. In America clips are not used,
and when American machine-made shoes were first introduced
into London they were fitted without clips. I am bound to
confess that these shoes did not shift on the feet to any
noticeable extent, but they are now all fitted with clips so I
suppose the workmen found they were an advantage. The
greatest evil resulting from clips is seen in slovenly fitting,
when the farrier with his knife carves out a great hole in the
wall in which to imbed the clip. As a clip is flat it cannot
be fitted to the rounded face of the wall, but all that is
necessary is to reduce the round to a flat surface with the
rasp, so that the clip may rest on it, care being taken that at
the extreme edge the horn is not left so prominent as to be
unduly pressed upon when the clip is driven close to the wall.
It is easy to lame a horse by violently hammering up the
clip, especially when the horn behind it has been so much
cut away as to leave only a thin protecting layer. A clip
should only be hammered up sufficiently to leave it firmly
applied to the wall. A bad workman in making his clip
may spoil the foot-surface of a shoe by causing a bridge on
the bearing surface of the iron at the toe, and this, on thin or
flat feet, may cause lameness.</p>

<p>A very unsightly appearance and very defective work
results from the fireman leaving his clip at right angles to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>the line of the shoe. It should be inclined backwards at
about the same slope as the portion of wall against which it
is to rest. The two diagrams (<a href="#Fig057">Fig. 57</a>) illustrate what is
meant.</p>

<p class="p2"><b>Hot and Cold Fitting.</b> When an engineer or a carpenter
has two surfaces to fit together with great exactness
he employs some colouring material to show where they do
come in contact and where they do not. When a farrier fits a
shoe to a horse's foot he tests its adaptation by applying it
at a dull red heat to the horn. This proceeding shows
with precision the bearing surfaces, as the horn is charred
in proportion to the contact. If the shoe be found not to fit
exactly, it is taken back to the anvil and altered. It is then
again for a few seconds applied to the horn and the surface of
contact examined. This proceeding is repeated until sufficient
exactness is arrived at and then the shoe is cooled ready
for nailing on. As horn is a bad conductor of heat this process
of "hot-fitting" does no harm to the sensitive structures
within the hoof unless it be carried to an extreme. When
the horn is very thin the heat of a shoe retained too long in
contact with it does serious mischief, and the injury known
as a burnt sole has often resulted from careless work. If a
shoe, whilst being altered to fit a foot, were cooled each time
it was laid on the hoof, it would have to be re-heated before
the necessary alterations could be made and this would cause
great waste of time. The abuse of hot-fitting may do harm
without any direct burning of the sole. An ill-fitting hot
shoe may be held on the hoof until it beds itself into the
horn and thus a complete correspondence between the surface
of the foot and the surface of the shoe be effected. Such a
proceeding is well described as "fitting the foot to the shoe"
and is not only destructive to the horn but damaging to the
foot by permitting an uneven shoe to look as though it were
properly fitting. When hot-fitting is used and not abused&mdash;when
it is adopted merely to indicate how and where the
shoe fits, and not to make it appear to fit&mdash;I consider it has
many advantages over cold-fitting. With some feet and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
some shoes it is quite possible to produce a good fit without
heating the shoe. When a shoe requires much alteration to
bring it into exact correspondence with the foot, even the
most expert farrier cannot do justice to his work with cold
iron&mdash;he gets as near to a fit as he can and when the hoof
is strong little harm is done. The best work is that which
includes the greatest exactness of fit, and uneven pressure
or loose shoes result from inferior work. A badly fitted shoe
requires more nails to retain it in place, and experience has
shown that hot-fitted shoes give a smaller average of loose
or lost shoes than those cold-fitted. The slight charring of
the end of the horn fibres which results from proper hot-fitting
has never been found to do injury, and it apparently
has some advantages. One is that the surface of the hoof
less readily absorbs moisture than when not charred. Another
is that the horn is softened for a time and expanded, allowing
nails to be easily driven, and then contracting and retaining
them more firmly. The objection to hot-fitting applies only
to its abuse. The advantages are greater exactness of fit,
greater security that the shoe will be firmly retained on the
foot, and greater facility in the operation of shoeing. Perhaps
I ought to add that when cold-fitting is inevitable
machine-made shoes are the best, because they are more
regular in form, and more often level on the foot-surface than
hand-made shoes. Army studs on active service, and studs
used in coal mines comprise, perhaps, the only animals upon
which cold-fitting is unavoidable.</p>

<p class="p2"><b>Tips</b> are short shoes protecting only the foremost half
of the foot. Upon grass or soft roads tips are quite sufficient
to prevent undue wear of the hoof. Even upon hard
roads tips will protect the hoof in dry weather, but in wet
seasons the horn becomes softened, and then that part coming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>in contact with hard road-surfaces wears rapidly and lameness
may follow. Tips require more care in use than shoes because
they protect from wear only the toe, and when retained
on the foot too long a time cause the hoof to become very
disproportionately long at the toe. In fitting a tip care must
be taken to afford the horse a level surface to bear on. The
unprotected horn at the back of the foot must take a bearing
on the ground level with the ground-surface of the tip. If
there is sufficient horn on the foot this can be easily effected
by only removing the overgrown wall to just the length the
tip extends and leaving the horn behind untouched. Where
there is not sufficient superfluous horn this method cannot be
used, and we apply a tip gradually thinned off towards its
hinder extremities. If a little horn can be removed obliquely
from the front half of the foot by a few strokes of the rasp
this "thinned" tip is more easily fitted so as to get a level
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>surface on the ground. When a horse has worn this form
for a month it is generally possible to bring a tip, of even
thickness throughout, into the same line of bearing as the
horn at the heels.</p>

<p>Tips do not give a good foot-hold on grass, but they afford
greater security of tread on hard smooth roads and on ice
than long shoes. The great advantages of tips are two-fold&mdash;they
are light, and they permit the greatest freedom of movement
and action in the posterior part of the foot. In some
cases of chronic foot lameness the use of tips and regular
work will effect soundness when every other method of
treatment has failed.</p>

<p class="p2"><b>The Charlier System</b> is a method of shoeing which
a few years ago took a very prominent hold on the fancy of
horse-owners. Like every other system it has advantages
and disadvantages&mdash;it has prejudiced enemies and indiscreet
friends. The principle or theory upon which it is based may
be thus stated. The lower border of the wall is, it is said, the
chief sustaining structure of the hoof, and as all that is
required of a shoe is to prevent undue wear, therefore,
remove a small strip of the lower border of the wall and
substitute for it a similar sized strip of iron, and we
shall protect from wear at the same time that we leave
entirely to nature every other part of the hoof&mdash;sole, frog,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>and bars. This seems eminently simple and logical, but
it is easy to show that it is more plausible than true.
First, I would point out that the wall <i>only</i> is not the
natural sustaining structure of the hoof. The wall <i>and
the sole at its connection with the wall is</i>. Next I deny that
the Charlier system does "leave entirely to nature every
other part of the hoof." In cutting away the wall from the
sole to affix the shoe, the natural function of the sole is
seriously interfered with, and the bearing on the wall which
ought to be partially distributed over the arch of the sole is
limited to the wall. It is claimed that when the foot has
had time to grow the sole will be found on a level with the
shoe, and thus directly sharing in the weight-sustaining
function. I have examined many feet shod by Charlier
specialists, and have never yet seen the sole of a hind foot
level with the shoe three days after the shoeing. Only once
have I seen the sole of the fore foot level with the shoe after
a week's wear. I am often apologetically told, "Well, it is
not quite in wear, but it is not an eight of an inch below the
surface of the shoe." Quite so, it is <i>nearly</i> in wear, but if
not actually in wear what becomes of the principle? The
sole is not directly in wear and bearing is confined to the
wall. As to the frog, the Charlier affords no greater use to
it than any other shoe of a similar thickness, unless instead
of being placed on sound firm horn it be dangerously let down
into the hoof so that its edge approaches very closely to the
sensitive foot. It is sometimes difficult to arrive at the truth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>as to the significance of the phrase "embedding or letting
down" the shoe of the Charlier system. At one time we are
assured that "the shoe is not sunk, the sole is permitted to
grow up." When this is so, very little positive objection to
the system can be taken, because the shoe then rests at the
same level on firm horn as does any other narrow shoe; but
then the frog takes no better bearing than in other systems
and the superfluous growth of horn on the sole is of no value.
When the shoe is really "let down" of course the frog does
receive increased pressure&mdash;it is forced to share with the wall
the primary function of sustaining weight instead of, as in
nature, taking only a secondary share of such action. It does
this at the expense of a shoe placed so close to the "quick"
that if the upper and inner border of iron be not bevelled off,
immediate lameness results. When the Charlier shoe was
first introduced it was applied the full length of the foot, but
it was found that when thinned by wear the heels spread and
led to injury of the opposite leg or to its being trodden off.
Now the Charlier is only applied like a tip round the front
portion of the surface of the foot, and it therefore partakes
of some of the advantages I have credited to tips. It is a
very light shoe and only requires small nails to fix it securely,
but as the shoe is only the width of the wall the nails have to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>be driven solely in the wall, and their position is open to the
objection applying to all too fine nailing. The disadvantages
of the Charlier are its being "let down" too near the quick,
its limited bearing, and its fine nail holes; the advantages
are the lightness and the freedom given to the back of the
foot, both of which are attainable with a narrow tip not let
down. One very apparent effect resulting from the use of
the Charlier system is the alteration in the action of the horse.
All knee action is lost, and some horses go decidedly tender
whilst others acquire a low shooting stride, which is certainly
not in accordance with our notions of good free locomotion.</p>

<h2><a name="VII">CHAPTER VII.</a><br /><br />
<small><span class="smcap">Roughing.</span></small></h2>



<p>In winter, ice, snow, and frost, render roads slippery, and
it is necessary to provide some arrangement whereby horses
may have the greatest security of foot-hold. In countries
such as Canada or Russia, where a regular winter sets in at
a tolerably uniform date and continues without intermission
for some months, it is easier to adopt a good system of
"roughing" than in Great Britain. There, on a thick layer
of ice or snow, sharp projections on the shoes cut into the
surface and afford foot-hold. The edge of the projections is
not soon blunted, and when once properly placed their duration
is as long as the time desirable for retaining the shoe.
Here, very different conditions obtain. Sometimes a week or
two of frost and snow may prevail, but more frequently
the spells of wintry weather are counted by days. Two or
three days of frost and then two or three days of mud and
slush, to be followed by either dry hard roads or a return of
ice and snow, is our usual winter. We require during this
time to provide for occasional days, or more rarely for weeks,
of frost-bound roads. Our horses' shoes wear about a month
and then require replacing by new ones. When roads are
hard and dry we want no sharp ridges or points about our
horses shoes, and yet we must always be able at twenty-four
hours notice to supply some temporary arrangement which
will ensure foot-hold.</p>

<p>The necessity for "roughing" and the evil effects of
continuing to work unroughed horses on slippery frost-bound
roads is demonstrated in London every winter by a very
significant fact. If after three days of ice and snow, anyone
will visit a horse-slaughterers' yard, he will find the place full
of dead horses which have fallen in the streets and suffered
incurable or fatal injury. A sudden and severe attack of ice
and snow half paralyses the horse traffic of a large town for a
day or two, and many owners will sooner keep their horses
in the stable than go to the expense of having them roughed.
The loss in civil life from unpreparedness for ice and snow is very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
serious, but the loss which has fallen upon military movements
from similar neglect is appalling. Napoleon's rout
from Moscow in 1814, Bourbaki's flight into Switzerland in
1871, and the Danish retreat upon Koenigsgratz in 1865
are terrible instances of the frightful loss sustained when
horses are unable to keep on their feet at a walk, let alone
drag guns and wagons over an ice-covered surface.</p>

<p class="center">Fig. 65.&mdash;Frost-nails, various.</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>A well-managed stud of horses which is required to face
all weather and to work every day through an English winter
should, from December 1st to March 1st, be shod in such a
manner as to be easily and speedily provided with mechanism
which will afford secure foot-hold. This may be effected
by the use of moveable steel "roughs" or "sharps." Of
course the cost is the argument against them, but this should
be considered in view of the probability or certainty of loss
which will follow from neglect. If we allow common
humanity to animals to enter into the consideration, economy
will be served by adopting a well arranged system of roughing.
Every good horseman appreciates the enormity of
over-loading, but neglect of roughing causes just as much
cruelty. A horse that on a good road can properly draw a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>ton would be considered over-loaded with two tons, and his
struggles to progress would at once attract attention. The
same animal with half a ton on an ice-covered surface would
suffer more exhaustion, fatigue, and fright, and run more
risk of fatal injury than in the case of the over-loading, but
his owner who would indignantly repudiate the one condition
will designedly incur the other.</p>

<p>Probably this is only thoughtlessness, but it is a reflection
on the prudence of a manager, and certainly not flattering to
the feelings or intelligence of a man.</p>

<p>There are many ways of providing foot-hold for a horse on
ice and snow. The most simple and temporary proceeding is
to use frost-nails. <a href="#Fig065">Fig. 65</a> shows various sizes and shapes
of these articles.</p>

<p>They are not driven through the hoof like ordinary nails,
but through the shoe only, which is prepared for their reception
at the time of fitting. A shoe to carry frost-nails is fitted
a little wider than usual at the heels and has at its extremities,
or more often at its outer extremities, countersunk
holes stamped and directed outwards so that the frost-nail
can be safely driven through by anyone and its shank turned
down over the shoe. There is a difficulty in firmly securing
them, they are apt to work loose and then become bent and
useless. If used on the inside heel of a shoe they constitute a
danger to the opposite leg should they bend and protrude from
under the shoe. As a temporary provision against a sudden
frost or fall of snow they are useful&mdash;but they are only a
make-shift.</p>

<p>The more permanent and effective system of "roughing"
consists in removing the shoes and turning down a sharp
chisel projection at the heels. In very bad weather a projecting
edge is also laid across the toe of the shoe.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">Fig. 66.&mdash;Heels of Fore and Hind Shoes, sharped.</p>
</div>
</div>



<p>The diagrams show the method of "sharping" a front and
hind shoe at the heels only. The hind shoe, having calkins,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>is not much altered. The smith simply converts the square
calkin into a sharp-edged one. The fore shoe having no
calkins is turned down at the heels to afford enough iron to
form the 'sharp.' But this shortens the shoe, and if it be
repeated two or three times, as it often is, the bearing
surface is spoiled, and the slightest carelessness in fitting
the shoe causes a bruised heel. 'Roughing' is generally
done in a hurry. A dozen horses reach the farrier's shop at
one time and all desire to return to work with as little delay
as possible. The work is perforce hurried through, careful
fitting cannot be done, and bad-footed horses suffer accordingly.
The dotted lines in <a href="#Fig066">Fig. 66</a> show the original
length of shoe, and the shortening which results from a
second roughing.</p>

<p>All horse-owners know how many lame horses result from
the repeated roughings necessitated by a week or two of
wintry weather. Some of this is inevitable from the rush
and hurry which cannot be prevented. Valuable horses with
weak feet should not be submitted to any such risk. They
should be shod with removable sharps. The mere fact of removing
a horse's shoes perhaps five or six times in a month
must injure the hoof. Add to this the shortening of the shoe,
the raising of the heel by the roughing, and the irregular
bearing due to hurried fitting and we have conditions which
only the very strongest feet can endure without serious
injury.</p>

<p class="center">Fig. 67.&mdash;Toe Sharp.</p>
</div>
</div>



<p>For heavy draught horses, and for all where the roads are
hilly, the toes as well as the heels must be 'sharped' when ice
and snow are firm on the surface. <a href="#Fig067">Fig. 67</a> shows this arrangement
at the toe. The removable steel "sharps," of which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>I have spoken, are certainly the least objectionable method of
providing foot-hold in winter. They are made in various
sizes to suit all kinds of shoes. They vary in shape somewhat,
but their form is more a matter of fancy than utility.
One in each heel of a shoe is the usual number used but if
snow and ice are plentiful and the roads hilly two additional
"sharps" may be placed at the toe of the shoe.</p>

<p class="center">Fig. 69.&mdash;Steel Sharps, screw.</p>
</div>
</div>



<p>At the time of fitting the shoes, holes are made by first
punching a round hole through the heels&mdash;and through the
toe if desired&mdash;then the hole is 'tapped' and a thread formed
to fit it in the shank of the sharp which is to fill it. If
the sharps are not immediately wanted the holes may be
filled with corks to keep out the grit and dirt. When corks
are used the wear of the shoe causes a burr to form round
the edge of the hole, and before the sharp can be screwed in a
"tap" must be worked into each hole to clear the thread.
One great objection to this method is that as the shoe wears
it becomes thinner, and if much worn the shank of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
"sharp" may be too long, and when screwed home cause
pressure upon the hoof and consequent lameness. To guard
against this steel "blanks" are used to preserve the holes,
and when a frost comes they are removed and the "sharps"
put in.</p>

<p>The blanks vary in height and of course those least in
height are best for the horse's action, but they must not be
allowed to get so worn that it is impossible to remove them.
These blanks are shown below.</p>

<p>The "tapping" and "screwing" of shoes is expensive,
and in small shops must be done by hand. In large shops
a gas engine and a machine would reduce the cost very
greatly, and if the system came into general use this method
of providing against frost-bound roads could be carried out
at much less cost than now. With a view to economy and
simplicity a sharp has been invented which requires no screw.
The shank may be either round or square. A hole is
punched in the heel of the shoe and carefully gauged to
the size of the shank of the "sharp." The sharp is then
put in and a tap of the hammer secures it. The difficulty is
to get the hole in the shoe and the shank of the sharp of
corresponding form and size. When this is done the sharp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
keeps its place and is not difficult to remove. Too often,
however, they are not uniform, and then the sharp falls out
or sometimes cannot be removed. When the holes are drilled
instead of punched the fit is more exact, but this only applies
to those with a round shank. A slight taper is given both to
the hole and the shank of the "sharp." As with the screw
sharps so with these, blanks are used to keep the holes open
until the road-surface requires the sharp.</p>

<p>No sharps should be left in shoes when the horses are
stabled at night, as serious injuries to the coronet may result
from a tread by the opposite foot. The coachman or horse-keeper
must be supplied with a spanner to remove the
screws, and with a tap to clear the holes if blanks are
not used.</p>

<p>For roads not badly covered with snow and ice, sufficient
security is afforded by some forms of india-rubber pads,
which will be described in a future chapter.</p>

<h2><a name="VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a><br /><br />
<small><span class="smcap">Injuries from Shoeing.</span></small></h2>



<p>Even with the most careful farrier injury may occur during
shoeing, or may arise as the result of the operation. Sometimes
the foot, from its condition or form, renders an accident
possible, and it may be so diseased, or defective, as to render
shoeing with safety very improbable. Sometimes the shoe
is to blame, and sometimes the nail or clip. A few words
about each of the common injuries may be useful as helps
to their avoidance or as guides to their remedying.</p>


<p class="p2"><b>From nails</b> two kinds of injury may result. The most
common arises from the nail being driven too near the sensitive
parts, and is known as a <i>bind</i>. The nail does not really
penetrate the sensitive foot, but is so near as to press unduly
upon it. This condition causes lameness, which is generally
not noticed till a day or two after the shoeing. It is readily
detected by the farrier on removing the shoe and trying all
the tracks of the nails in the hoof by pressure with pincers.
When the lameness is slight removal of the nail and one or
two days rest are all that is required. When the lameness
is great it may be suspected that the injury has caused the
formation of matter within the hoof. This must, of course,
be allowed to escape, and the services of a veterinary surgeon
are advisable.</p>

<p>Any neglect in these cases, such as working the horse after
lameness has appeared, or delay in removing the offending
nail, may lead to very serious changes in the foot, or even
to death of the horse.</p>

<p>Another injury caused by nails is from a direct puncture
of the sensitive foot. This may be slight, as in cases where
the farrier in driving the nail misdirects it and so stabs
the sensitive parts, but immediately withdraws the nail
knowing what has happened. The lameness resulting from
this is usually slight. Very much more serious is the lameness
resulting from a nail which pierces the sensitive foot
and is not recognised at once by the farrier. As a rule,
lameness is immediate, and should the horse perform a
journey before the nail is removed, serious damage is certain
to follow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>Want of skill in driving a nail is not always the chief
cause of "binding" or "pricking" a horse. More often
than not the form and position of the nail-holes is the primary
cause, for if the nail-holes in the shoe are too "coarse"
or badly pitched it is quite impossible to safely drive nails
through them. Sometimes the nails are defective, and this
was much more common when nails were all hand-made.
Bad iron or bad workmanship led to nails splitting within
the hoof, and whilst one half came out through the wall
the other portion turned in and penetrated the sensitive foot
causing a most dangerous injury. The best brands of
machine-made nails, now generally used, are remarkably
free from this defect.</p>

<p>No lameness resulting from injury by a nail should be
neglected. If detected and attended to at once few cases
are serious. If neglected, the very simplest may end in
permanent damage to the horse. By treating these accidents
as unpardonable, horse-owners rather encourage farriers to
disguise them or to not acknowledge them. If the workman
would always be careful to search for injury and when he
found it acknowledge the accident, many simple cases would
cease to develop into serious ones. Frank acknowledgement
is always best, but is less likely to take place when it is
followed by unqualified blame than when treated as an
accident which may have been accompanied by unavoidable
difficulties.</p>


<p class="p2"><b>From clips</b> lameness may arise. A badly drawn clip
is not easily laid level and flat on the wall. When hammered
down excessively it causes pressure on the sensitive foot, and
lameness. When side clips are used&mdash;one each side of the
foot&mdash;it is not difficult to cause lameness by driving them
too tightly against the wall. They then hold the hoof as
if in a vice. When shoes get loose or are partially torn off
the horse may tread on the clip, and if it be high and sharp
very dangerous wounds result.</p>


<p class="p2"><b>From the shoe</b>, injury results from any uneven pressure,
especially when the horny covering of the foot is
weak and thin. The horn becomes broken and split, and
the bearing for a shoe is more or less spoiled. Flat
feet are liable to be bruised by the pressure of the inner
circumference of the shoe at the toe. Lameness from
this cause is easily detected by removing the shoe and
testing the hoof with the pincers. If attended to at once,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
and the bearing of the shoe removed from the part little
injury results. If neglected, inflammatory changes in the
sensitive parts are sure to arise.</p>


<p class="p2"><b>Corns</b> in horses are due to bruising of the angle of the
sole by the heel of the shoe. A wide open foot with low
heels is most likely to suffer, but any foot may be injured.
The most common seat of injury is the inner heel of a
fore-foot. Even a properly fitted shoe may cause a corn
if retained too long upon a foot, as then, owing to the growth
of the hoof, its extremity is carried forward from beneath the
wall so as to press upon the sole. A short shoe, fitted too close
on the inside, is the most common cause of corn. To guard
against the shoe being trodden on by the opposite foot the
inside is generally fitted close, and to guard against being
trodden on by the hind foot it is often fitted short. Thus
to prevent accidents of one kind methods are adopted which,
being a little overdone, lead to injury of another. A not
uncommon error in the preparation of the foot for shoeing
may also lead to the production of the so-called corn. If
the wall on the inside heel be lowered more than it should
be the horn of the sole is left higher than the wall, and
then a level shoe presses unevenly upon the higher part.</p>

<p>A corn, be it remembered, is not a tumour or a growth,
it is merely a bruise of the sensitive foot under the horn
of the sole. It shows itself by staining the horn red, just as
a bruise on the human body shows a staining of the skin
above it. To "cut out a corn" with the idea of removing it is
simply an ignorant proceeding. If a corn be slight all that
is necessary is to take off the pressure of the shoe, and this is
assisted by removing a thin slice or two of horn at the
part. When the injury is very great matter may be formed
under the horn, and of course must be let out by removal
of the horn over it. Provided there is no reason to believe
that matter has formed, a corn, <i>i.e.</i>, the bruised and discoloured
horn, should not be dug out in the ruthless manner
so commonly adopted. Cutting away all the horn of the sole
at the heels leaves the wall without any support. When the
shoe rests upon the wall it is unable to sustain the weight
without yielding, and thus an additional cause of irritation
and soreness is manufactured. The excessive paring of
corns is the chief reason of the difficulty of getting permanently
rid of them. The simplest device for taking all
pressure off a corn is to cut off an inch and a half of the
inner heel of the shoe. With the three-quarter shoe (<a href="#Fig073">Fig. 73</a>)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>a horse will soon go sound, and his foot will then resume its
healthy state. The saying "once a corn, always a corn" is not
true, but it is true that a bruised heel is tender and liable
to bruise again, from very slight unevenness of pressure,
for at least three months. All that is necessary is care in
fitting and abstention from removal of too much horn at the
part. Of course when the degree of lameness is such as to
suggest that matter is formed the horn must be cut away so
as to afford an exit for it, but the majority of corns are
detected long before the stage of suppuration has resulted
from a bruise.</p>


<p><a name="Fig073"></a></p>

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">Fig. 73.&mdash;Three-quarter Shoe.</p>
</div>
</div>



<p class="p2"><b>A burnt Sole.</b> In fitting a hot shoe to a foot it sometimes
happens that the sensitive parts under the sole at the
toe are injured by heat. This is most likely to occur with
a foot on which the horn is thin, especially if it also be flat or
convex. Burning the sole is an injury which must be put
down to negligence. It does not occur from the shoe being
too hot but from its being too long retained, and may be
expected when the fireman is seen holding a dull-red hot
shoe on to a foot, with a doormen assisting to "bed it in"
by pressing it to the foot with a rasp. When the heat
of a shoe penetrates through the horn with sufficient intensity
to blister the sensitive parts of the foot great pain and
lameness result. In many cases separation of the sole from
the "quick" takes place, and some weeks pass before the
horse can resume work.</p>


<p class="p2"><b>Treads</b> are injuries to the coronet caused by the shoe
of the opposite foot, and are usually found on the front or
inside of the hind feet. The injury may take the form of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>bruise and the skin remain unbroken, it may appear as a
superficial jagged wound, or it may take the form of a
tolerably clean cut, in which case, although at first bleeding
is very free, ultimate recovery is rapid. Bruises on the
coronet&mdash;just where hair and hoof meet&mdash;are always to be
looked upon as serious. The slighter cases, after a few days
pain and lameness, pass away leaving only a little line
showing where the hoof has separated from the skin. This
separation is not serious unless a good deal of swelling has
accompanied it, and even then only time is required to effect
a cure. In more serious cases an extensive slough takes
place, and the coronary band which secretes the wall may be
damaged. The worst cases are those in which deep seated
abscesses occur, as they often terminate in a "quittor." The
farrier should always recognise a tread as possibly dangerous
and obtain professional advice.</p>

<p>It is a common custom to rasp away the horn of the wall
immediately beneath any injury of the coronet, but it is a
useless proceeding which weakens the hoof and does no good
to the inflamed tissues above or beneath.</p>

<p>Treads are most common in horses shod with heavy shoes
and high calkins&mdash;a fact which suggests that a low square
calkin and a shoe fitted not too wide at the heels is a possible
preventive.</p>


<h3 class="no-break">"Cutting" or "Brushing."</h3>

<p>By these terms is meant the injury to the inside of the
fetlock joint which results from bruising by the opposite
foot. Possibly some small proportion of such injuries are
traceable to the system of shoeing, to the form of shoe, or to
the action of the horse. They are, with few exceptions, the
direct result of want of condition in the horse and are almost
confined to young horses, old weak horses, or animals that
have been submitted to some excessively long and tiring
journey. The first thing a horse-owner does when his horse
"brushes" is to send him to the farrier to have his shoes
altered. In half the cases there is nothing wrong with
the shoes, and all that is required is a little patience till
the horse gains hard condition. At the commencement of
a coaching season half the horses "cut" their fetlocks, no
matter how they are shod. At the end of the season none
of them touch the opposite joint, with perhaps a few
exceptions afflicted with defective formation of limb,
or constitutions that baffle all attempts at getting hard
condition. The same thing is seen in cab and omnibus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>stock. All the new horses "cut" their legs for a few
weeks. The old ones, with a few exceptions, work in any
form of shoe, but never touch their joints. They "cut"
when they are out of condition&mdash;when their limbs soon
tire; but they never "cut" when they are in condition&mdash;when
they have firm control of the action of their limbs.
There are, however, a few horses that are always a source
of trouble, and there are conditions of shoeing which assist
or prevent the injury. The hind legs are the most frequently
affected and this because of the calkins. Many horses will
cease "cutting" at once if the calkins of the shoes be
removed and a level shoe adopted. There are certain forms
of shoe which are supposed to be specially suitable as preventives.
A great favourite is the "knocked-up-shoe"&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
a shoe with no nails on the inside except at the toe,
and a skate-shaped inner branch.</p>


<p><a name="Fig074"></a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 70%" >
<img src="images/095.jpg" alt="" style="width: 80%" />
<div class="caption">
<p class="center">Fig. 74.&mdash;"Knocked-up" Shoes&mdash;with and without an inner Calkin.</p>
</div>
</div>



<p>These shoes are fitted not only close to the inner border
of the wall but within it, and the horn at the toe is then rasped
off level with the shoe. Whether they are of any use is a
question, but there is no question of the harm they do to the
foot. Some farriers are partial to a three-quarter-shoe&mdash;one
from which a couple of inches of the inside heel has been
removed. Some thicken the outside toe, some the inside
toe. Some raise one heel, some the other, and some profess
to have a principle of fitting the shoe based upon the
formation of the horse's limb and the peculiarity of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
action. If in practice success attended these methods I
should advise their adoption, but my experience is that
numerous farriers obtain a special name for shoeing horses
that "cut," when their methods, applied to quite similar
cases, are as antagonistic as the poles. A light shoe without
calkins has at any rate negative properties&mdash;it will not
assist the horse to injure himself. For all the other forms
and shapes I have a profound contempt, but as people will
have changes, and as the most marked departure from
the ordinary seems to give the greatest satisfaction, it is
perhaps "good business" to supply what is appreciated.</p>

<p>The two great cures for "cutting" are&mdash;regular work and
good old beans. When a man drives a horse forty miles
in a day at a fast pace he, of course, blames the farrier for
all damage to the fetlocks. He is merely illogical.</p>

</div>
</div>




<h3 class="no-break">Over-reaching.</h3>

<p>This is an injury to the heel&mdash;generally the inner&mdash;of a
front foot. The heel is struck by the inner border of the
toe of the hind shoe. Over-reach occurs at a gallop in this
country, but is seen in America as the result of a mis-step
in the fast trotters. An over-reach can only occur when
the fore foot is raised from the ground and the hind foot
reaches right into the hollow of the fore foot. When the fore
and hind feet in this position separate the inner border of the
toe of the hind shoe catches the heel of the fore foot and cuts off
a slice. This cut portion often hangs as a flap, and when it
does the attachment is always at the back, showing that the
injury was not from behind forwards as it would be if caused
by a direct blow, but from before backwards&mdash;in other words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
by a dragging action of the hind foot as it leaves the front
one. An over-reach then may result either from the fore
limb being insufficiently extended, or from the hind limb
being over extended.</p>

<p>The prevention of this injury is effected by rounding off
the inside edge of the hind shoe as shown below.</p>

</div>
</div>




<h3 class="no-break">Speedy-cut.</h3>

<p>This is an injury inflicted on the inner surface of the
lower part of the knee joint by a blow from the toe of the
shoe of the opposite foot. It occurs at a trot, and very
seldom except when a horse is tired or over-paced. A horse
that has once "speedy-cut" is apt to do so again and it may
cause him to fall. Such horses should be shod "close"
on the inside, and care should be taken that the heels
of the foot which strikes should be kept low. In some
cases a three-quarter shoe (see <a href="#Fig073">Fig. 73</a>) on the offending foot
prevents injury.</p>


<h3 class="no-break">"Forging" or "Clacking."</h3>

<p>This is not an injury but an annoyance. It is the noise
made by the striking of the hind shoe against the front as
the horse is trotting. Horses "forge" when young and
green, when out of condition or tired. As a rule, a horse
that makes this noise is a slovenly goer, and will cease to
annoy when he gets strength and goes up to his bit. Shoeing
makes a difference, and in some cases at once stops it.
The part of the front shoe struck is the inner border round
the toe. (<a href="#Fig077">Fig. 77</a>). The part of the hind shoe that strikes is
the outer border at the inside and outside toe. (<a href="#Fig078">Fig. 78</a>).</p>

<small><span class="smcap">Shoeing Bad Feet.</span></small></h2>



<p>Any average farrier can shoe without immediate harm a
good well-formed foot that has a thick covering of horn, but
when the horn is deficient in quantity or quality injury soon
takes place if a badly fitted shoe be applied. There are
feet which from disease or accident or bad shoeing have
become, more or less, permanently damaged. Some are
seriously altered in shape. Some are protected only by an
unhealthy horn, and some show definite changes which cause
weakness at a special part. These are the feet which really
test the art of the farrier, for he must know just what to do
and what not to do, and must possess the skill to practice
what he knows.</p>


<p class="p2"><b>Flat Feet.</b> Some horses are born with flat feet, others
acquire them as the result of disease. Too often the flat sole
has another defect accompanying it&mdash;low weak heels. Such
feet are best shod with a seated shoe so as to avoid any
uneven pressure on the sole, and the shoes should always be
fitted a little longer than the bearing-surface of the foot,
so as to avoid any risk of producing a bruise at the heel&mdash;in
other words, of causing a corn. The seated shoe is not
advisable on a hunter. The concave shoe used for hunters
has many distinct advantages and only one disadvantage
for a flat foot, viz, that it has a wide flat foot-surface. It
may cause an uneven pressure at the toe on a flat sole, but
this is easily avoided by not making it too wide; perhaps the
very worst thing to do with a flat foot is to try and make
it look less flat by paring it down. The thinner the horn
the greater the chance of injury to the sensitive parts under
it, and every injury tends to make the sole weaker. Leaving
the sole strong and thick, whilst fitting the shoe to avoid
uneven pressure, is the principle of shoeing to be adopted
with flat feet.</p>


<p class="p2"><b>Convex Soles.</b> The sole of the foot should be concave,
but as the result of disease many feet become convex.
This bulging or "dropping" of the sole varies in degree
from a little more than flat to an inch or so below the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
level of the wall. When the under-surface of a horse's foot
resembles in form the outside of a saucer, fitting a shoe
becomes a work of art. Very often the wall is brittle and
broken away and it is most difficult to find sufficient bearing-surface
on the foot for a shoe. Many of these feet may
be safely shod with a narrow shoe that rests only on the
wall and the intermediate horn between the wall and sole.
Such a shoe may, according to the size of the foot, be five-eighths
or even three-quarters of an inch wide. Its thickness
is to be such as will prevent the sole taking any direct
bearing on the ground, and sometimes a shoe of this form
is much thicker than it is wide. The advantage of this shoe
is that it is so narrow that any bearing on the sole is
avoided. The disadvantage is that on rough roads the sole
may be bruised by the flint or granite stones. When the
horn of a "dropped" sole is very thin, or when the horse
has to work on roads covered with sharp loose stones, some
cover for the sole is necessary and the narrow shoe is not
practicable. To provide cover for the sole, the web of
the shoe has to be wide, and, therefore, the foot-surface of
the shoe must be seated out so as to avoid contact with
the sole. Too often the seating is continued from the inner
to the outer border of a shoe, so that no level bearing-surface
is provided for the wall to rest on. This kind of shoe is
like the hollow of a saucer, and when applied to a foot is
certain to cause lameness soon or later. Each time the
horse rests his weight on it the hoof is compressed by the
inclined surface of the shoe, which instead of providing
a firm bearing-surface affords only an ingenious instrument
of torture.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">Fig. 80.&mdash;A level bearing surface.</p>
</div>
</div>




<p>In even the worst of these deformed feet some good sound
horn is to be found at the heels, where an inch or sometimes
two can be utilised for level bearing. No matter how much
seating is required at the toe and quarters, the heel of
the shoe may always be made level.</p>

<p>It cannot be too strongly urged that in the preparation
of feet with bulging soles no horn is to be removed from
the sole. The toe is to be shortened, the heels lowered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>proportionately, and the bearing-surface of the wall made
level with a rasp. At no place must the shoe rest on
the sole. In nearly every case the toe is left too long
and the bearing taken upon it by the shoe only increases
the deformity. In many feet a large slice might be sawn
off the toe with advantage, as the sensitive foot is separated
from the wall by a mass of diseased horn which presses the
wall at the toe forward. (<a href="#Fig081">Fig. 81</a>).</p>

</div>
</div>




<p class="p2"><b>Sandcracks.</b> This is the name given to cracks in
the wall which commence at the coronet and extend downwards.
From their position at the toe, or at the side of the
hoof, they are sometimes called respectively "toe-cracks"
and "quarter-cracks." The crack may be very slight and
may exist without causing lameness. It may appear suddenly,
accompanied by great lameness and by the issue of blood
from between the edges of the divided wall. These are grave
cases which require surgical attendance. Sandcracks are
most commonly seen in dry brittle feet, and the horses
most subject to them are those employed in heavy draught
work. Railway shunt-horses and omnibus horses are very
liable to be troubled with sandcracks in the toe of the
hind feet.</p>

<p>In shoeing for this defect there are two things to
avoid, (<i>a</i>) not to place any direct pressure on the part;
(<i>b</i>) not to fit a shoe which will tend to force the crack open.
Following these lines it is well not to put a clip exactly
over a crack. If at the toe place a clip each side of the
crack, and never use calkins or high heels which throw the
weight forward. If at the quarter avoid a spring-heeled
shoe which permits the downward movement of the foot
behind the crack and so forces it open. In all cases, after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>fitting the shoe level to the foot, remove a little more horn
just below the crack so as to relieve the direct bearing on
the part. (<a href="#Fig082">Fig. 82</a>).</p>


<p><a name="Fig082"></a></p>

</div>
</div>



<p>In the case of crack extending the whole space of the
wall some provision should always be made to keep it from
opening, because every step of the horse, especially when
drawing a load, causes an outward pressure at the coronet.
This pressure forces the hoof apart and the injury caused
does not cease with the pain and lameness which follow, and
which may be temporary. Doubtless the original cause of a
sandcrack is some morbid condition of the coronary band&mdash;the
band from which the wall grows. The sensitive laminæ
are at first not affected further than by the inflammation consequent
upon the direct tearing which occurs when the crack
takes place. The continued irritation, kept up by a persistent
fissure in the horn covering the laminæ, soon causes other
serious changes which tend to make the sandcrack a permanent
disease. Thus even the smallest crack should be attended
to and measures adopted to prevent its enlargement or, when
extensive, to limit all opening and shutting movement of the
hoof.</p>


<p><a name="Fig083"></a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 80%" >
<img src="images/103b.jpg" alt="" style="width: 80%" />
<div class="caption">
<p class="center">Fig. 83.&mdash;French Clips in Position.</p>
</div>
</div>



<p>This is sometimes attempted by a simple leather strap tightly
applied, or by binding the foot with string or tape. Tape
is less liable to slip than string. When the hoof is sufficiently
thick two nails may be driven in opposite directions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>transversely through the crack and clinched; or French sandcrack-clips
(<a href="#Fig083">Fig. 83</a>) may be used which are easily applied. The
instruments necessary are shown below (<a href="#Fig084">Fig. 84</a>). The iron (<i>b</i>)
is made red-hot and pressed on the
hoof over the crack so as to burn a
groove each side of it. Into these
grooves the clip (<i>a</i>) is put and the
pincers (<i>c</i>) are then used to compress
the clip firmly into its place.
There is a strain upon the clips,
and sometimes one breaks. It is
therefore necessary always to use
two, and for an extensive crack
three may be employed.</p>


<p><a name="Fig084"></a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 40%" >

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">Fig. 84.</p>
</div>
</div>



<p>All these appliances tend to keep
the lips of the crack from separating,
but they do not prevent the
edges of a deep wide crack from
being forced together and thus
pinching the sensitive parts. To
provide against this injury a slip
of hard wood may be fitted into
the crack, and then the nails or
clips may be more safely drawn
tight without fear of injury, and
with a better chance of preventing
any movement in the edges of the
crack. To insert the wood, the
crack is converted into a groove
nearly as deep as the wall, about
three-eights of an inch wide, with
straight sides, or better still, with a
little greater width at the bottom
than at the surface. Into such a
groove a piece of wood formed to
fit it is gently driven from below
and rasped off to fit exactly. Or,
softened gutta-percha may be pressed
firmly into the space and levelled off when cold.</p>

<p>To "cut out" a sandcrack except for the purpose of refilling
it is bad practice as it favours movement and helps to
make the defect permanent. To rasp away the horn so that
only a thin layer is left is also injurious. No horn should be
removed except for the fitting of a plug as above described or,
under veterinary direction, for the purpose of giving vent to
matter which has formed within the hoof.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>
<p>In many European countries a shoe is used for toe-cracks
which has two clips drawn on the inside border of the shoe
at the heels. These clips catch the bars of the hoof and
prevent the heels of the foot closing in. The idea is that
when the wall at the heels contracts, there is a tendency
for the wall at the toe, if separated by a crack, to open.
<a href="#Fig085">Fig. 85</a> shows the position of the clips which must be
carefully fitted so as to rest on the inside of the bars. Mr.
Willis, V.S., has tried these shoes and speaks well of their
utility.</p>


<p><a name="Fig085"></a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 60%" >

<div class="caption">
<p class="center">Fig. 85.&mdash;Shoe with Heel Clips for Sandcrack.</p>
</div>
</div>



<p>When the crack is in the quarters of the foot, it is not the
tendency to expansion of the hoof that has to be guarded
against. It is the downward motion of the heels that
forces open a crack in this position. The farrier provides
against this by taking care to have a firm bearing of the
shoe on the hoof behind the crack as shown in <span class="smcap">A</span> <a href="#Fig082">figure 82</a>.</p>


<p class="p2"><b>Contracted Feet.</b> Some diseases of the foot lead to
contraction of the hoof, which is most noticeable round the
coronet and at the heels. Any long continued lameness
which prevents the horse placing the usual weight on the
foot may be accompanied by contraction. Constant cutting
away of the bars and paring the frog so that it takes no
contact with the ground also leads to shrinking in of the
heels. By lowering the heels and letting the frog alone
many feet will in time widen out to their proper size, but no
system of shoeing is so good for contracted feet as the
use of tips, which leave the whole back part of the hoof
to take direct bearing on the ground.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>
<p>Many shoes have been invented for forcing open the
heels of contracted feet. Some have had a hinge at the
toe and a movable screw at the heel. Some have had the
bearing-surface at the heels made with a slope outwards,
(See <a href="#Fig053">Fig. 53</a>, <a href="#Page_74">page 74</a>) so that the weight of the horse should
constantly tend to force the heels apart. There is no necessity
for any of these contrivances. A properly fitted tip (See
<a href="#Page_78">page 78</a>) will permit the hoof gradually to expand to its
healthy size and form.</p>


<p class="p2"><b>Seedy-toe.</b> This is a condition of the wall usually
found at the toe but not uncommon at the quarters. It
is not common in hind feet but occurs sometimes. When
the shoe is removed a separation is noticed between the sole
and the wall, and this separation may extend up the wall
nearly to the coronet. As a rule the space so formed is
a narrow one, but it may be wide enough to admit three
fingers of a man's hand. Probably all seedy toes result
from some injury or disease of the coronary band from which
the wall grows, and the first appearance is not a cavity
but a changed and softened horn, which may be dry and
crumbly, or moist and cheesy. The diseased horn may be
scraped out and the cavity filled with tar and tow. The
wall bounding the cavity should be relieved of all pressure
on the shoe, and if a radical cure be desired all the unattached
wall should be cut away. This, however, should be
done under veterinary guidance.</p>


<p class="p2"><b>Turning in of the Wall.</b> By this expression, I mean
those cases of weak low-heels in which the border of the
wall turns inward. Such a form of horn offers no suitable
bearing for a shoe, and if submitted to pressure by a shoe
gets worse. Too often this condition is treated by paring
away the sole within, which increases the deformity. The
sole should not be cut but be left as strong as possible.
The curled-in border of the wall should be cut down and all
bearing taken off the shoe. In one or two shoeings the
wall will resume its proper form. When both heels are so
affected, and the horse has to remain at work, only one heel
must be treated at a time. The extreme point of the heel is
never affected, and affords a point for bearing when the
border of wall in front of it is cut away so as not to touch
the shoe.</p>

<h2><a name="X">CHAPTER X.</a><br /><br />
<small><span class="smcap">Leather and Rubber Pads.</span></small></h2>




<p>In the days when farriers were driven by theoretical
teachers to pare out the soles and otherwise rob the foot of its
natural covering of horn, artificial protection had frequently
to be given to the foot. A horse with a thin sole could not
travel over rough roads, on which sharp loose stones were
plentiful, without great risk of injury; consequently in those
times plates of leather were often used to protect the foot.
When a horse went "a little short" his owner not unnaturally
concluded that he had bruised his foot and that the protection
of a leather sole would be beneficial. In many cases the defective
action was due to other cause than bruising, but still
the leather was adopted, and it soon became an accepted theory
that leather soles modified concussion and protected the foot
from jar. This is more than doubtful, and I hold a very firm
opinion that a plate of leather between the shoe and the foot
has no such effect, whilst it interferes with the exactness of
fit of the shoe. "Leathers" are useful on weak feet to protect
a thin or defective sole from injury. When the under
surface of a foot has been bruised, cut through, or when it is
diseased, leather offers a useful protection, but when the sole
is firm and sound it is quite unnecessary.</p>

<p>To apply leather properly, a square piece fully the size of
the shoe is taken. A portion is then cut out where the clip
has to fit and all protruding parts cut away level with the
border of the shoe. If applied without more precautions, an
open space would be left between leather and sole into which
mud and grit would find their way and the leather would
soon be cut through by resting on the irregular surface of the
frog. To prevent this mischief the under surface of the foot
is made level before the shoe is applied. The leveling is
managed by spreading a paste of tar and oatmeal over the sole,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
and filling up the space at the sides of the frog with tow.
Then the shoe with the leather is nailed on in the usual manner.</p>

<p>The belief in leather as an anti-concussive appliance has led
to the use of what are called "ring-leathers." These are not
plates covering the whole under surface of the foot but narrow
bands fixed between shoe and hoof. They are absolutely useless,
in fact their only possible effect is to spoil the fit of the
shoe. Plates of india-rubber have been tried between the shoe
and the foot as preventives of concussion. They invariably
fail by reason of their effect upon the shoe. At each step
when the weight of the horse comes on the foot the elastic
rubber yields, the shoe is pressed closer to the foot, the nails
are loosened, and when the foot is raised the rubber rebounds.
The shoe soon becomes so loose that it is cast or torn off.
Nothing elastic should be placed between shoe and foot.
When an elastic or spring is applied it must be between the
shoe and the ground.</p>

<p>Various arrangements have been adopted to supply the
horse's foot with some provision against concussion. Injured
and diseased feet may no doubt be benefitted by some elastic
appliance which secures them from the jar of contact on a
hard road. They may be protected against direct bruise.
The healthy foot requires no such protection. Nature has
covered it with a thick layer of horn and has provided against
concussion by quite other means&mdash;by the co-ordinate action of
muscles, by the oblique position of the pastern and by the
construction of the back part of the foot.</p>

<p>Quite apart from any attempt to prevent concussion a valuable
use has been found for india-rubber pads in connection
with horse-shoeing. The improvement in modern road-surfaces
has been accompanied by an increased facility for slipping,
and it has been found that no material gives such security of
foot-hold on smooth surfaces as india-rubber.</p>

<p>The earliest of these contrivances with which I am acquainted
was formed so as to leave the frog uncovered whilst
a bearing of rubber was given all round the inner circumference
of the shoe. This pad had a wide flat border which
fitted under the shoe, with which it was nailed on to the
foot. Its great objection was that it could not be nicely fitted
on many feet without first cutting away the bars.</p>

<p>Then we had rubber pads which were not nailed on with
the shoe, but which fitted into the shoe and were removed at
will. The objection to these was that they could only be used
with a seated shoe and could not be applied with a narrow
shoe or one possessing a flat foot-surface.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>The next form to appear was a leather sole on which an
artificial frog was fixed. Great difficulty was at first experienced
in fixing this frog so that it remained firm. The
difficulty has not yet been surmounted by all makers, but
Mr. G. Urquhart, of London, makes a most reliable article.
These "frog-pads" certainly give a very good foot-hold on
all kinds of paved streets.</p>

<p>A pad of very elegant appearance is "Sheather's Pneumatic."
It is not solid like the ordinary frog-pad but hollow
and is compressed at each step but immediately resumes its
prominent form on being relieved of pressure.</p>

<p>One of the simplest anti-slipping pads is "Balls &amp; Keep's
Wedge-pad." It possesses one advantage in not covering up
the whole under-surface of the foot. When properly fitted
it is firmly retained and does its work, but a careless farrier
may so apply it that it shifts on the foot. To fit it exactly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
the wall of the back part of the foot must be lowered more
than that in front, so that shoe, foot and pad may all be closely
adjusted.</p>

<p>What is called the "Bar-pad" is a leather plate on which
an india-rubber pad occupies the whole of the back portion
and it is fixed to the foot with a short shoe. This pad is not
only an anti-slipping agent, it is anti-concussive, and for
some diseases and some injuries of the heels is a most valuable
appliance. For long-standing "corns," for cases of chronic
laminitis, and for horses that markedly "go on their heels"
the bar-pad is without doubt the most efficient arrangement
yet invented. The best are made by Mr. Urquhart.</p>

<p>All these pads increase the cost of shoeing but what they
save, by preventing falls and injuries to the horse and fear
and anxiety to the driver, far more than balances the account
in their favour. The cost however is an item, and inventors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>have turned their attention to the production of some other
methods of applying rubber in connection with the shoe for
the prevention of slipping.</p>

<p>Shoes have been manufactured into which cavities of
different forms and sizes have been made. These are filled
by correspondingly shaped pieces of rubber. The cavity must
be so formed as to retain the rubber and this renders the
manufacture very difficult except by the employment of
malleable cast iron shoes. This is a great disadvantage.</p>

<p>Another plan is to make from rolled bar iron, a hollow shoe,
section of which would be <span class="smcap">U</span>-shaped but level to the foot. Into
the groove so formed a thick cord of rubber is placed after the
shoe is nailed on the foot. This wears well and affords good
foot-hold but it entails the serious objection that the nails are
difficult to drive and far from being so safe as in the ordinary
shoe. If rubber is ever to be available in a grooved shoe it
should be designed so that the nails and nail holes are not
interfered with.</p>

<h2><a name="XI">CHAPTER XI.</a><br /><br />
<small><span class="smcap">Shoeing Competitions.</span></small></h2>




<p>The Agricultural Societies that have made Horse-shoeing
Competitions a feature of their Annual Shows have distinctly
done good to the art. In those districts which have had the
benefit of these competitions for many years past, horse-shoeing
is best done. In those districts where no competitions
have been held shoeing is generally badly done. When the
farrier takes a pride in his work he is more careful with details.
Provided proper principles are adopted, no calling is
more dependent upon care in details for the best results than
that of the farrier. Competitions stimulate emulation amongst
men. Public appreciation, as displayed by the prominence
given to the art by the Show authorities and by the admiring
crowd that generally assembles to see the men at work, encourages
a feeling of responsibility and gratifies the natural
and honest pride of the workman. Very few trades have
suffered more from public neglect and indifference than that
of the farrier.</p>

<p>The success of a shoeing competition depends almost entirely
upon the secretary of a show, unless that officer has
amongst his stewards an energetic horseman who has grasped
the importance of good shoeing and who possesses some
organising powers. In this connection I may perhaps offer
a word of acknowledgement for the work done by Mr. Clay,
to whose energy and skill the Royal Agricultural Society has
for many years been indebted for the success of its valuable
annual shoeing competition.</p>

<p>All the arrangements for the competition must be completed
before the work is commenced, and upon their
perfection depends the success of the whole thing. There
should, if possible, be two classes&mdash;one for heavy horses
and one for light horses. At large competitions there
should also be a champion class. There are farriers who travel
from show to show and generally appear in the prize list.
This handicaps the local men, and is not encouraging to
those who have not quite risen to front rank. The object of
the competition is to improve the work of the district, and it
is quite a question whether the rules should not exclude men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
who have taken, say, two first prizes at any large competition.
The only argument in favour of letting the well known smith
who has taken many prizes enter a competition is that his
work may be seen, examined and imitated. By confining prize
winners to the champion class this good would be attained; at
the same time more encouragement would be given to local
men.</p>

<p>The necessities for a competition include anvils, fires, tools,
iron and horses.</p>

<p>For every five men there should be one anvil with its
accompanying vice and forge. The anvil should be so placed
that the sun is not full on the face of the workman. The
exact relative position of anvil, vice and forge should be entrusted
to a practical farrier, and the whole placed the night
before they are wanted. Coal, nails and iron should also be
provided. If competitors are allowed to bring their own iron
or nails some poor man may be placed at a disadvantage, and
the habitual competitor, versed in every detail, is given an
advantage. Each man should bring all smaller tools he may
want. In broken weather a canvas roof should be supplied
both for horses and workmen. At all times a temporary
wooden floor should be put down for the horses to stand upon.
This should be a little longer than the line of anvils so that
each man has his horse opposite his anvil. It should be at
least twelve feet deep so that there is room enough behind
and in front of the horses for men to pass. On the side
farthest from the anvils a firm rail must be fixed to which
the horses' halters may be tied, and outside of this&mdash;at least
six feet distant&mdash;should be another line of post and rails to
keep back spectators.</p>

<p>Horses have to be borrowed or hired, and one horse is
sufficient for two competitors. Care should be taken not to
have any horse with unusually bad feet. The most suitable
horses are those with overgrown hoofs. Under no circumstances
should a vicious or very fidgety horse be selected.</p>

<p>When time is not an object, the best test of a workman is
to require him to make a fore and hind shoe and put them on
the horse. At a one-day show, or at a competition when the
entries are large, it is sufficient to require the making of a
fore and hind shoe and the fitting and nailing on of the front
one. A reasonable time should be fixed, and undue haste
should be deprecated.</p>

<p>There should always be two judges, who should be supplied
with books in which each division of the operation of shoeing
should be separately marked. There are only three important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
divisions of the subject: (1) Preparation of the Foot, (2)
Making the Shoes, and (3) Fitting and nailing on.</p>

<p>Sometimes these operations are marked separately for fore
and hind feet. I consider this quite unnecessary. There is
not sufficient difference either in principle or detail to require
each foot to be specially marked. The judge of course notes
every thing in his mind, and it is sufficient for him to estimate
and mark the value of the work under the three different
operations. The great fault I find with most competitions is
that "the preparation" of the foot for the shoe is not more
strictly defined. The competitors are permitted to mix up
the "preparation" and the "fitting." Some of them do
nothing to the foot until they commence to fit the shoe. This
is wrong, and every foot should be properly prepared&mdash;the
bearing-surface formed and the proportions of the hoof attended
to&mdash;before the fitting is attempted. A rule to this
effect should be added to the conditions in the schedule of the
competition. Each judge may perhaps be permitted to fix
his own standard of marking but a uniform system would be
useful for comparison. If the maximum be indicated by too
small a figure difficulty often arises in exactly determining the
merits of men who have come out equal in the totals, and
there is too often, in a large class, a number whose marks are
about equal. The three operations&mdash;preparing the foot,
making the shoe, fitting and nailing on&mdash;are about equal in
value. A maximum of five points in each is too small a number
to make distinctive marking easy, but there is nothing gained
by adopting a higher maximum than ten. A marking sheet
for the judges of a shoeing-competition may be something in
this form:</p>

<p class="p2">The stewards should see that each competitor has a number,
and that the same number is attached to the side of the horse
on which he works. The steward also should take the time
at which each batch of competitors commence and see that
none exceed it.</p>

<p>Excessive rasping of shoes should be prohibited, and the
men should see the sizes and kinds of nails provided so that
they may make their "fuller" and nail holes accordingly.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>
<p>Shoeing competitions are almost entirely confined to country
districts. It is a great pity that they are not attempted in
large towns. The only difficulty is the expense. It would
well repay large horse-owners to subscribe and support this
method of improving the art.</p>

<p>In conclusion I must say that the best of all ways to improve
the art is by giving practical instruction at the anvil.
A few lessons from a competent practical teacher are worth
more than all books or lectures, as the work has then to be
done, errors are pointed out and corrected, and reasons given
for each step as it is attempted.</p>

<p>The Berkshire County Council has adopted a travelling forge&mdash;the
suggestion of Mr. Albert Wheatley, V.S., of Reading&mdash;which
is accompanied by an instructor and passes from town
to town and village to village. In this way is supplied the
tuition which used to be obtained by apprenticeship to a good
workman. Other County Councils should adopt this method.</p>

<p><small>"India-rubber pads on leather enable many horses, whose feet are not
sound, to work free from lameness; they also tend to prevent slipping. This
is especially the case with Urquhart's 'bar pads,' respecting which my veterinary
friends at Manchester, where they are largely used, inform me that they
prevent slipping quite as much if not more, than the Charlier plan of shoeing

<big>"The Safest Nails to Use."</big><br />
</p>

<p><b>They never split in driving.</b></p>

<p><b>They never buckle in the hardest hoof.</b></p>

<p><b>They are flexible to clinch, and the clinch holds against
any strain in service.</b></p>

<p><b>Their perfect points make a clean cut hole in the most
brittle hoof.</b></p>

<p><b>They are absolutely uniform in length, breadth, and thickness.</b></p>

<p>
<span class="u"><b>They are manufactured in London from the best Swedish Iron</b></span>,
the quality of which is improved in compactness,
tenacity, and uniformity of temper by the "Capewell Process."
</p>


<hr class="ad1" />



<p>As demonstrated by actual mechanical tests at Chicago, the
tensile strength of the Capewell is greater than that of any other
nail made. Thus it is that the Capewell nails never break under
the heads but hold the shoe until it is worn out.</p>
